# Introduction to File Naming Conventions

Computers don't always know how to handle certain characters. Neither [Microsoft Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx) or [Apple OSX](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202808) allow files to be named with special characters like questions marks `?` or slashes `\`. Special characters, spaces, and other elements are frequently reserved and possess meanings beyond the language we are speaking or typing. For example, periods `.` are used by operating systems to separate the descriptive file name from the extension (file type).

Many standard services and servers, including those employed in creating our digital edition, function best with the guidelines outlined below and files named in a different way can create errors.

The guidelines below describe general good practice for file naming in computing, but these names are not always the easiest to read or use in everyday personal computing.

_For more general information about file naming conventions in computing, please see Purdue Libraries [Data Management for Undergraduate Researchers](http://guides.lib.purdue.edu/c.php?g=353013&p=2378293) which links to this clear guide: [Folder and File Naming Convention â€“10 Rules for Best Practice](http://www.exadox.com/en/articles/file-naming-convention-ten-rules-best-practice)._

# Computing Guidelines

- Use only alphanumeric characters (letters in the English alphabet + numbers)
- Use all lowercase letters
- Do not use spaces anywhere in your file's name
- Do not use special characters such as: `! # $ % & ' @ ^ `` ~ + , . ; = ) ( "`
  - No periods, commas, question marks, etc.
- The only characters allowable other than alphanumeric characters are: hyphen/minus sign `-`, underscores `_`, and plus signs `+`
- For spaces between words
  - Use the hyphen/minus sign `-`
  - Example: `painting-out-verdigris`
- For spaces between elements (e.g. date, description, name, etc.) - _This is also known as an "element delimiter"_
  - Use the underscore `_`
  - Do not use spaces or other characters such as: `! # $ % & ' @ ^ `` ~ + , . ; = ) ( "`
  - Example: `20160906_painting-out-verdigris` (date\_description)
- Order your elements from general to specific
  - This is most important for dates: Year, Month, Day
  - (YYYYMMDD), (YYMMDD), (YYMM), etc
  - Example: 20160906
