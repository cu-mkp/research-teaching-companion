# Introduction to using the command line

-   For more info on bash: [<u>https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash#opening-your-shell</u>](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash#opening-your-shell)

    -   Contains information, tutorials, and commands

-   Command: `man \[command, e.g., ls\]`

    -   Brings up the manual for that particular command, showing its rules

-   Command: `git status`

    -   Lets you know the relative status of your local repo v the remote/origin

-   Command: `git log`

    -   Lets you see what’s been going on in Git recently

-   Command: `df -h`

    -   Checks how much free space you have on your computer

-   Command: `ls`

    -   Gives you a list of the folders/files in your current directory

-   Command: `ls -la`

    -   Gives you a list of ALL (even hidden) files in your current directory

-   Command: `cd`

    -   = change directory: helps you change directories

    -   If you type “cd” with nothing after it, it will take you back to your home directory

    -   If you type “cd” with the name of a parent or child directory relative to where you are, you will move to that directory

    -   SHORTCUT: type “cd” and then the first character or two of your desired directory, then press \[tab\] and it will fill in the directory that matches the beginning of these characters

        -   If this freezes, then there is more than one directory that begins the same way. Type another character or two so it is unique

-   Command: `cd ..`

    -   = go up a level in directories

    -   `cd ../..` = go up 2 levels!

-   Command: `less` \[filename of a file in your current directory\]

    -   Allows you to see the file’s contents

    -   NB: for filenames with spaces, precede each space with a backslash

-   Command: `pwd`

    -   = print working directory: tells you where you are (what directory you’re in)

-   Command: `mkdir`

    -   = make directory: create new directory

-   Command: `mv` \[filename\] \[new filename\]

    -   = move (but actually means rename the file)

-   Command: `touch`

    -   Creates a quick file

-   DANGER: Command: `rm -f` \[filename\]

    -   = remove, force (don’t ask questions or check if you’re sure)
