## The Companion

The syllabi [LINK], step-by-step lesson plans [LINK], and sample student projects [link] included in this Companion to the digital edition [*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) result from our many years of research, teaching, and learning together during the Making and Knowing Project’s construction of the edition and since its publication in 2020.

The graduate students in the course *Craft and Science: Making Objects in the Early Modern World*&mdash;taught 2014-18&mdash;conducted text-, object-, and laboratory-based research that resulted in the edition's approximately 130 [essays](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays) which interpret, contextualize, and reconstruct the content of Ms. Fr. 640. The Companion contains syllabi for each of the eight versions of _Craft and Science_, focused each year on a different theme: Moldmaking and Metalworking; Colormaking (including dyes, pigments, artificial gems, coloring woods and metals, and varnish making); Practical Knowledge: Vernacular Natural History, Practical Perspective, Optics, Mechanics, and Medicine; Ephemeral Art; and Printmaking, Inscription, and Impression. We hope these syllabi will be a source of inspiration and provide a practical guide in the complexities of integrating seminar discussion and critical anaylsys with hands-on work in the laboratory or studio. In teaching these hands-on research seminars, we tried to balance about 8 weeks of hands-on skill building with 8 weeks of individual (or group) research and writing. During the weeks of skill building, we brought in for short periods "expert makers" (whose essays are also included in the edition) whose practice focused around the year's theme. Their essays reflect upon some of the ways we all learned together during these skill building sessions. As for the student essays, We came only gradually to a form of writing by which we could combine argument driven historical writing with descriptions of the laboratory making and reconstruction processes. In this, the students' hybrid lab/field notes [LINK] were essential, and much time and effort went into recording and formatting these notes. The resulting essays, then, encapsulate much of the learning and many of the dynamics of the work of combining hands-on with critical analysis, which we hope will be useful to others in creating their own courses and research projects. For more information on this course, see [Making the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_329_ie_19).

With the edition complete, we transitioned in 2021 to a new mixed graduate and undergraduate course, *Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History*, in which students explore *Secrets of Craft and Nature* to create projects&mdash;involving all kinds of research&mdash;that extend the content of the edition in creative and sometimes surprising ways. The duration of the course period for this class is only about 2 hours/week (in contrast to the 4 hours of _Craft and Science_). This presents a serious challenge to hands-on work in the classroom, and it was out of this need to streamline the hands-on work that our Lesson Plans [LINK] emerged. As you can see from the syllabi for this course, the hands-on sessions incorporate many of the skill building activities of _Craft and Science_. The Lesson Plans and associated teaching resources included in the Companion provide step-by-step guidance in planning, tools and ingredients, and the processes of the hands-on work. These lesson plans have been used by instructors from high school to graduate courses, and their experiences and advice can be found in Using M&K Resources [LINK].

During development of the edition, we taught digital humanities courses that integrated methods and tools of digital scholarship in which the students helped to prototype the edition. The syllabi for these courses provide information about minimal computing and the open access technology that underlie the edition and our digital publication tool, *EditionCrafter*. The student projects resulting from these courses are included in this Companion [LINK to Digital Fr. 640] and on the Project's [Sandbox](https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/), where digital projects using the data of the edition.

We have had much opportunity to reflect on the challenges and the joys of inserting hands-on work into the text-centered training of the university, and we hope the materials in Reflections on How-To [LINK] will provide food for thought and action and a guide of sorts for your own experiments.

## The Edition

[*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) is a digital critical edition and English translation of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640 held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This edition presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text in French transcription and English translation for the first time, and situates its contents in their material and historical context.

The manuscript provides a view into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century, and gives rare insight into techniques and processes for making art and daily life objects, as well as into how nature was used in art, collected, and appreciated in early modern Europe.

The Making and Knowing Project created *Secrets of Craft and Nature* through a series of collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that involved students, craft practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and social sciences, natural and computer scientists, and scholar-practitioners from the digital humanities.

## The Making and Knowing Project

The [Making and Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org/), founded in 2014 by Pamela H. Smith, and involving hundreds of collaborators, is a research and pedagogical initiative in the [Center for Science and Society](https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. See [Credits]({{< ref "credits" >}}) and, on the Project's website, [Collaborations](https://www.makingandknowing.org/collaborators/).

The Project explores the intersections between historical craft making and scientific knowing. Drawing on techniques from both laboratory and archival research as well as studio practice and the digital humanities, the Making and Knowing Project aims to cross the science/humanities divide.

The creation of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been the Project’s primary endeavor since 2014. This goal has shaped the Project’s methodology of fusing pedagogy with research, using a focused research object (Ms. Fr. 640) to teach historical, hands-on, and digital research methods while generating research outputs.

_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ sheds light not only on what kind of knowledge the manuscript’s anonymous author-practitioner possessed about techniques and materials, but also, more broadly, how his work of making was related to knowing.

Indeed, the overarching theme of the Project and its work on _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been to show the ways in which making is an epistemic activity. In other words, making is itself a form of knowledge and not just an application of knowledge.
