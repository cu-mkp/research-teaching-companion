# Introduction to the Research and Teaching Companion

## Research and Teaching Companion

This Research and Teaching Companion is intended to support you in engaging with hands-on experimentation in your teaching, research, and/or artistic practice and making.

The resources included in this Companion to the digital edition [*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) result from many years of research, teaching, and learning together during the [Making and Knowing Project’s](https://www.makingandknowing.org/) construction of this edition (2014-2020) and since its publication in 2020. [*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) is a digital critical edition and English translation of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640 held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This edition presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text that provides a view into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century and gives rare insight into techniques and processes for making art and daily life objects, as well as into how nature was used in art, collected, and appreciated in early modern Europe.

During the intensive series of collaborative courses, workshops, and conferences through which the edition was created, We have had much opportunity to reflect on the challenges and the joys of inserting hands-on work into the text-centered training of the university, and we hope the materials in this Companion will provide food for thought and action and a guide of sorts for your own experiments. They are intended to be used flexibly, and we invite you to adapt and create your own resources to fit your needs.
