# Introduction to the Research and Teaching Companion

## Research and Teaching Companion

This Research and Teaching Companion is intended to support you in engaging with hands-on experimentation in your teaching, research, and/or artistic practice and making.

The resources included in this Companion to the digital edition [*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) result from many years of research, teaching, and learning together during the [Making and Knowing Project’s](https://www.makingandknowing.org/) construction of this edition (2014-2020) and since its publication in 2020. 

[*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) is a digital critical edition and English translation of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640 held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This edition presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text that provides a view into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century and gives rare insight into techniques and processes for making art and daily life objects, as well as into how nature was used in art, collected, and appreciated in early modern Europe.

During the intensive series of collaborative courses, workshops, and conferences through which the edition was created, we have had much opportunity to reflect on the challenges and the joys of inserting hands-on work into the text-centered training of the university, and we hope the materials in this Companion will provide food for thought and action and a guide of sorts for your own experiments. They are intended to be used flexibly, and we invite you to adapt and create your own resources to fit your needs.

## The Companion's Resources

### [Making & Knowing Syllabi]({{<ref "syllabus" >}})
Syllabi from the Making and Knowing Project can suggest possible readings, discussion prompts, model the integration of hands-on activities with discussion of relevant concepts and texts, and link instructors to resources for hands-on activities. These syllabi contain links to essays from the edition for use as course readings and describe possible lessons around hands-on activities, while Student Projects resulting from these courses can be consulted by instructors and students for inspiration and to consider the many ways to engage with Ms. Fr. 640 and its digital edition.

### [Lesson Plans for Hands-on]({{<ref "activitysheet" >}})
Making and Knowing Lesson Plans and the associated teaching resources included in the Companion provide step-by-step guidance in planning, tools, ingredients, sourcing, and the processes of the hands-on work. These Lesson Plans can be integrated into courses or research projects as skill building, to spark the historical imagination, or as a as a stand alone activity that immerses students or event audiences in hands-on work with materials. 

### [Student Projects]({{<ref "project" >}})
Numerous Student Projects were developed in the course *Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History*, in which students explore *Secrets of Craft and Nature* and undertake a variety of hands-on activities and research around it, ranging from humorous to scholarly, pedagogical, and public facing. These projects provide models for the variety of paths by which to enter into _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, extending its content in creative ways and demonstrating how hands-on experience can be integrated into student learning.

### [M&K Resources in Use]({{<ref "casestudy" >}}) 
The Making and Knowing Project has many collaborators from K-12 to university, to non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions, who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project's methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their syllabi, student projects, and making activities are valuable for those seeking to integrate the Making and Knowing resources available from this Companion.

### [Reflections on Hands-On]({{<ref "reflection" >}})
Why engage in hands-on activities in teaching and research? The Making and Knowing Project has had much opportunity to reflect on the challenges and the joys of inserting hands-on work into the text-centered training of the university, and we hope the lectures, videos, and reflections on hands-on pedagogy will provide food for thought and action.

### [Digital Making and Knowing]({{<ref "digital" >}})
The Making and Knowing Project has developed digital resources, including competency tools, syllabi, and ideas for student projects.
