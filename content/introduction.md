# Introduction to the Research and Teaching Companion
## Research and Teaching Companion
This Research and Teaching Companion is intended to support you in engaging with hands-on experimentation in your teaching, research, and/or artistic practice and making.

The resources included in this Companion to the digital edition [*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) result from many years of research, teaching, and learning together during the [Making and Knowing Project’s](https://www.makingandknowing.org/) construction of this edition (2014-2020) and since its publication in 2020. 

[*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) is a digital critical edition and English translation of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640 held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This edition presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text that provides a view into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century. It gives rare insight into techniques and processes for making art and daily life objects, as well as into how nature was used in art, collected, and appreciated in early modern Europe.

During the intensive series of collaborative courses, workshops, and conferences through which *Secrets of Craft and Nature* was created, the Making and Knowing Project has had much opportunity to reflect on the challenges and the joys of inserting hands-on work into the text-centered training of the university. We hope the materials we developed through this experience will provide food for thought and action and a guide of sorts for your own experiments. They are intended to be used flexibly, and we invite you to adapt and create your own resources to fit your needs.

For more about the creation of the Companion, and the Making and Knowing Project’s suite of Research and Teaching Resources, see [About M&K](/about).

## The Companion's Resources
### Making & Knowing Syllabi
[Syllabi from the Making and Knowing Project's courses](/resources/syllabi/) model the integration of hands-on activities with discussion of relevant concepts and texts, and they can be mined for possible readings, discussion prompts, and hands-on lessons. These syllabi contain links to essays from _Secrets of Craft and Nature_ for use as course readings and suggest how to plan and coordinate hands-on activities. Student Projects created in these courses can be consulted by instructors and students for inspiration and to consider the many ways to engage with Ms. Fr. 640 and its digital edition.
### Lesson Plans for Hands-on
[Making and Knowing Lesson Plans](/resources/activity-sheets/) and the associated teaching resources included in the Companion provide step-by-step guidance in planning, tools, ingredients, sourcing, and the processes of hands-on activities. These Lesson Plans can be integrated into courses or research projects as skill building, they can be used to spark the historical imagination and raise questions, or as stand alone activities that immerse students or event audiences in hands-on work with materials. 
### Student Projects
Numerous [Student Projects](/resources/student-projects/) were developed in the course *Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History*, in which students explore *Secrets of Craft and Nature* and undertake a variety of hands-on activities and research in connection with it. The resulting projects range from humorous to scholarly, pedagogical, and public facing. These projects provide models for the variety of paths by which to enter into _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, extending its content in creative ways and demonstrating how hands-on experience can be integrated into student learning.
### M&K Resources in Use
The Making and Knowing Project has many collaborators from K-12 to university and in non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project's methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their [syllabi, student projects, and making activities](/resources/case-studies/) are valuable for those seeking to integrate the Making and Knowing resources available in this Companion.
### Reflections on Hands-On
Why engage in hands-on activities in teaching and research? In this section, the Making and Knowing Project team members and collaborators reflect in [lectures, videos, and testimonials](/resources/reflection/) on their reasons for and experience of engaging in hands-on teaching and research.
### Digital Making and Knowing
The Making and Knowing Project has developed open access [digital resources](/resources/digital/), including a publication tool for making your own edition, model projects for using the data of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, digital literacy tools, syllabi, and ideas for student activities.
## Digital Development of the Companion
Webpage content and navigation for the [Making and Knowing Project](https://makingandknowing.org/)'s Research and Teaching Companion is built on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework. The Companion on GitHub: https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/.
