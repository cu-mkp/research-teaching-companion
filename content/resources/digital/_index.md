# Digital Making and Knowing
The Making and Knowing Project has developed open access digital resources, including a publication tool for making your own edition, model projects for using the data of *Secrets of Craft and Nature*, digital literacy tools, syllabi, and ideas for student activities.

Read a reflection on using the data of *Secrets of Craft and Nature*: [A Computational Approach to Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_301_ie_19) by Clément Godbarge.

## The Making and Knowing Project Sandbox
The [Sandbox](https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/) makes available a number of [projects](https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/docs/index-digital-projects.html) that utilize and explore the data underlying [*Secrets of Craft and Nature*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/). The Sandbox presents experimental, provisional, and in-progress work that engages with and analyzes the data, topics, and content of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, as well as the larger themes explored by the Making and Knowing Project. The Sandbox includes syllabi for Digital Humanities courses taught by the Making and Knowing Project and Student Projects carried out in those courses.

The Sandbox is an online environment for students, scholars, and others to explore and experiment with the Project’s data using a variety of digital tools, where others can add and create their own tools, case studies, and add to the resources presented here. This is also a space for sharing teaching resources, exploring methods and processes across disciplines and levels of expertise, and engaging in knowledge exchange wherever possible.

## EditionCrafter
An open source and customizable publishing tool, [EditionCrafter](https://editioncrafter.org) allows users to easily publish digital editions as feature-rich and sustainable static sites, based on the feature set of *Secrets of Craft and Nature*.
 
EditionCrafter was developed as a collaboration between the Making and Knowing Project and Performant Software Solutions to address the need for a scholarly publication tool that integrates primary sources, commentary, and textual analysis. As a publication tool, EditionCrafter facilitates the dissemination of original research through the creation of a digital editions. Researchers, students, and institutions such as libraries, historical societies, archives, and community groups can grant public access to valuable textual sources across disciplines.

A platform for collaborative research and for pedagogy, EditionCrafter provides space for critical engagement with texts. Scholars and students alike can use digital tools to share not only data and finished products, but also documentation of the process of textual engagement and analysis.

Editions are published through well-established technologies and workflows and can be maintained with minimal costs and resources, helping to address issues of sustainability and longevity.
