The Making and Knowing Project has collaborated with many institutions, including University of Glasgow Technical Art History Group, Rhode Island School of Design Glass Department, Brown University History Department, Wake Forest University History and Chemistry Departments [LINK], University of Oregon, Eugene {LINK], Vassar College [LINK], Texas A&M University, and Oberlin Art History {LINK]. Further collaborations with Victoria & Albert Museum/Royal College of Art Postgraduate Program in the History of Design [, and University of Amsterdam Technical Art History and Conservation Training Programs saw our students working in parallel and sometimes by remote co-working on reconstructions and hands-on activities. During the construction of the digital edition, over 450 collaborators from universities, museums, and research centers worldwide interacted with the aims and techniques of the project and gained familiarity with the rich and multifaceted contents of the manuscript. These collaborators and others began to request assistance and resources from the Project for teaching and research, which helped impell the Project to develop the Research and Teaching Companion

The Project has also experimented with Companion resources in broader outreach activities, adapting the Project’s use of historical reconstruction in pedagogy for K-12 (Princeton International School of Mathematics and Science; École Secondaire Notre-Dame, Woodstock, and The Pierrepont School[LINK TO GANS VIDEO]) and non-traditional academic settings (Nunavut Arctic College [link to Bilak lesson plan with article etc.]; Genspace Community Biology Lab [link to lesson plan). A former student-participant in the Project Text Workshops, Heather Wacha (see [essay](https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_318_ie_19)), held small-scale text workshops using Project methods and protocols, based on [Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/content/resources) developed during the Project's Text Workshops.

### Spring 2022: ARTH 295 (OC): Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World \[[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQbugAa655DEXQrOFr0M29BK_MCLZEDPdQm8QlQl1M4qkU1Igx9FcP1NkHONbiveQ/pub)\]

Spring 2022
Oberlin College
Professor Christina Neilson, Associate Professor of Art History
- **Course description:** This course investigates what it meant to make things and work with materials, including featherwork, imitation gems, color making, and metal casting, in Europe and colonial Latin America between around 1350 and 1650. We will follow historical descriptions and recipes to reconstruct methods of making, and learn from expert practitioners who are holders of traditional techniques and meanings, including indigenous makers. We will consider how a wide range of practitioners developed hands-on knowledge in workshops, laboratories, marketplaces, gardens, etc. and we will explore how making was and is a form of knowledge, how there are different systems of knowledge, and the intersections between art making and science.
- **Sample student portfolio reports:**
Similar to M&K's [Fieldnotes](https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/), these portfolios document the students' hands-on activities, which included [Stucco for Molding]({{< ref "stucco-assignment" >}}), "Keeping Dry Flowers in the Same State all Year" from the bottom of [folio 120v in BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl), and making and painting [cochineal lake]({{< ref "pigment-cochineal-lake_assignment" >}}) and [verdigris]({{< ref "verdigris-assignment" >}}) pigments.
