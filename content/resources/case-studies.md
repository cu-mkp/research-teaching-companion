# Making and Knowing Resources in Use
The Making and Knowing Project has many collaborators from K-12 to university, to non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions, who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project's methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their syllabi, student projects, and making activities are valuable for those seeking to integrate Making and Knowing resources into their teaching and research.

## Collaborator Pilot Courses
Materials from courses taught by Project collaborators, some using resources from this Sandbox or developed in consultation with the Making and Knowing Project.

### Spring 2022: ARTH 295 (OC): Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World \[[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQbugAa655DEXQrOFr0M29BK_MCLZEDPdQm8QlQl1M4qkU1Igx9FcP1NkHONbiveQ/pub)\]

Spring 2022
Oberlin College
Professor Christina Neilson, Associate Professor of Art History
- **Course description:** This course investigates what it meant to make things and work with materials, including featherwork, imitation gems, color making, and metal casting, in Europe and colonial Latin America between around 1350 and 1650. We will follow historical descriptions and recipes to reconstruct methods of making, and learn from expert practitioners who are holders of traditional techniques and meanings, including indigenous makers. We will consider how a wide range of practitioners developed hands-on knowledge in workshops, laboratories, marketplaces, gardens, etc. and we will explore how making was and is a form of knowledge, how there are different systems of knowledge, and the intersections between art making and science.
- **Sample student portfolio reports:**
Similar to M&K's [Fieldnotes](https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/), these portfolios document the students' hands-on activities, which included [Stucco for Molding]({{< ref "stucco-assignment" >}}), "Keeping Dry Flowers in the Same State all Year" from the bottom of [folio 120v in BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl), and making and painting [cochineal lake]({{< ref "pigment-cochineal-lake_assignment" >}}) and [verdigris]({{< ref "verdigris-assignment" >}}) pigments.

### ARTS 150: Global Art History Survey II (Renaissance to Modern)
Texas A&M University
Dr. Tianna Uchacz, Assistant Professor of Art History
- **Course description:** A large lecture survey of architecture, painting, sculpture and the minor arts around the world from the 14th century to the end of the 20th century. ARTS 150 counts toward a Core Curriculum Creative Arts requirement and toward Intercultural Diversity course requirements.
#### Honors Section: Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, Spring 2024
In these semesters, students enrolled in the Honors section of Uchacz's ARTS 150 (2â€“7 students per semester) were invited to complete hands-on activities in the history of artisanal making alongside the regular ARTS 150 coursework (lectures, textbook readings). The honors program encourages high-impact practices that deepen student engagement with course themes and material. Accordingly, Uchacz's students participated in at least three of the following activities, which built on several M&K skill-building activities:
- [pigment making from natural materials]({{< ref "../activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments" >}})
- [paint making and test-card painting with a variety of binders and hand-made natural pigments]({{< ref "../activity-sheets/activitysheet_paintingpigments" >}})
- East Asian brush and ink calligraphy
- paper marbling
- [imitation stucco making]({{< ref "../activity-sheets/activitysheet_stucco" >}})

## Collaborator Workshops

### Bio Art Workshops, School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts, Texas A&M University
Spring 2023
Naomi Rosenkranz, Dr. Tianna Uchacz, Dr. Donna Janes, Dr. Sumeyye Yar

This 4-day workshop was held in March 2023 at Texas A&M University. It was organized by Tianna Uchacz as a series of guest labs for her graduate course "Art/Craft: Hands-on Global Histories of Materials, Techniques & Skilled Making." The labs were co-led by Naomi Rosenkranz (M&K) and Donna Janes (Microbiology, Texas A&M) in consultation with Sumeyye Yar. The activities, a 2-day dyeing workshop using cochineal insects, paired with a 2-day painting workshop using bioluminescent bacteria, built on workshops that Rosenkranz and Yar had developed and led at Genspace community lab, Brooklyn. 10 faculty and 26 students from the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts took part.
