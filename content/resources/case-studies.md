# Making and Knowing Resources in Use
The Making and Knowing Project has many [collaborators](https://www.makingandknowing.org/collaborators/) from K-12 to university, to non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions, who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project's methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their syllabi, student projects, and making activities are valuable for those seeking to integrate Making and Knowing resources into their teaching and research.

## Collaborator Pilot Courses
Materials from courses taught by Project collaborators, some using resources from this Companion or developed in consultation with the Making and Knowing Project.

### Experiment
Spring 2018, University of Oregon, Clark Honors College<br>
Vera Keller, Professor of History

- [Experiment Syllabus](/documents/pdf/sp18_Keller_Vera_syllabus_experiment.pdf) 
- **Course description:** The course *Experiment* explores the origins of experimental science in early modern Europe (15th-18th centuries), and incorporates hands-on activities. In 2018, students researched Ms. Fr. 640 then read essays in *Secrets of Craft and Nature*. The class had the chance to Skype with current and former Making and Knowing students, who were able to answer questions and respond to critiques. The course included a number of experimental reconstructions, including a “Boyle’s Law” demonstration and growing of Seignette Salts. Students described the process of these experiments in a period voice (voice of Boyle or voice of the author-practitioner), and discussed what is at stake in the various literary technologies employed. For more on the various literary technologies, see Vera Keller, [Four Manuscripts between the Recipe and the Experimental Essay](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_320_ie_19).

Christina Neilson, Associate Professor of Art History

- [Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World Syllabus](/documents/pdf/sp22_nielson_christina_syllabus-arth-295_ingenious-making_web-version.pdf) (also available as [DOCX](/documents/docx/sp22_nielson_christina_syllabus-arth-295_ingenious-making_web-version.docx))
- **Course description:** This course investigates what it meant to make things and work with materials, including featherwork, imitation gems, color making, and metal casting, in Europe and colonial Latin America between around 1350 and 1650. We will follow historical descriptions and recipes to reconstruct methods of making, and learn from expert practitioners who are holders of traditional techniques and meanings, including indigenous makers. We will consider how a wide range of practitioners developed hands-on knowledge in workshops, laboratories, marketplaces, gardens, etc. and we will explore how making was and is a form of knowledge, how there are different systems of knowledge, and the intersections between art making and science.
- **Reflections on teaching Ingenious Making:** In this video, Christina Neilson and Heather Galloway speak about their experience using the Making and Knowing Project's Hands-on Lesson Plans in a class at Oberlin College.

- **Course description:** Students explored what it means for historians to engage in experimentation and the pedagogical value of burning, breaking, and substituting materials. Beyond reading texts, the course also involved a practical component as students engaged with knowledge production by actually making things. This practical assignment, in lieu of a written research paper, was modeled after the Making and Knowing Project. Reconstructions included armillary spheres, techniques for repairing ceramic, and a “simple and convenient x-ray.” The second practical component of the course involved translating broader research questions into a podcast. Podcasts include essays on plastic surgery, mapping mountains, and ritualized cremation. View the projects and podcasts on the [course website](https://edblogs.columbia.edu/hseaw4110-001-2018-1/).

### Genspace Community Science/Art Workshops
#### Coloring Textiles with Bugs: Old (Cochineal) and New (Bacteria)
Naomi Rosenkranz & Dr. Sumeyye Yar, 2018-19

Sponsored by the Center for Science and Society and [Genspace Community Lab](https://www.genspace.org/)

**Workshop description:**
[Genspace Community Lab](https://www.genspace.org/) is a Brooklyn-based community lab that provides an open space for STEAM education, bringing together the arts and sciences in an educational setting, including a host of public workshops and classes. Developed and taught by Sumeyye Yar and Naomi Rosenkranz, a series of workshops were help at Genpace in May 2018, September 2018, December 2018, and November 2019. Yar and Rosenkranz received a Public Outreach grant from Columbia's Center for Science and Society to design and hold workshops exploring colorant sustainability through renewed interest in old methods (dyeing with natural colorants) and new scientific breakthroughs (painting with pigmented bacteria) to combat the pollution and hazards of "fast fashion" and the textile industry. Each workshop was held over two days, 3-4 hours on each day, and combined interactive presentations and discussion, directed making sessions, and open creative time in the lab. Each participant created a hybrid textile collage with cochineal-dyed fabrics and and textiles printed with pigmented bacteria. 

In this workshop, participants
- Learn about the history and chemistry of natural colorants and dyes
- Follow 500-year-old recipes from the Renaissance to dye wool and silk yarns with cochineal bugs
- Learn how genetic engineering and bacterial cultures can be used to replace synthetic dyes in the future
- Paint with bacteria and then print your designs on cotton
- At the end, combine printed microbial designs with hand-dyed cochineal textiles to create a decorative art piece to take home

#### Dyeing and Painting with Nature: The Chemistry of Cochineal
Naomi Rosenkranz, April 2019

Building upon the workshop, Coloring Textiles with Bugs, Rosenkranz created another Genspace workshop that looked at both dyes and pigments made from cochineal. 
- **Workshop description:** Join Genspace for a hands-on exploration of natural colorants where we will focus on the tiny but powerfully-colorful cochineal bugs. We will look at the fascinating history of cochineal use and the chemistry behind transforming organic matter into usable color, learning about the relationship (and differences) between dyes and pigments, and how you can make them in the lab or at home in your kitchen. Following 500-year-old recipes and using modern chemistry, we will learn three different methods for extracting the cochineal color. We will dye textiles and make pigments with bugs, and each participant will walk away with a tube of lab-made paint!

### Dyeing with Cochineal - A Short High-School Workshop
Reece Brown (undergraduate, Columbia University), Spring/Summer 2023

Created as her final project in the Making and Knowing Project course, _Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History_ (HIST GU4962), Reece Brown designed and taught a workshop on dyeing with cochineal to high school students in an environmental science class.

- **Workshop Description:** This workshop explores cochineal from three different disciplines: biology, chemistry, and history. We will begin by discussing its life cycle and habitat, then pivot to focus on the particular compound for which it is known, i.e., carminic acid. The flow of this lesson follows the transformation of materials during the process of dyeing, turning cochineal from a resource to a material to a product. Every step in the “recipe” will be contextualized briefly prior to the hands-on endeavor, then more fully explored in a conversation as we wait for the materials to heat to the proper temperature. This outline lets the process and material reality come first, then provides more abstract information once students have oriented themselves in the world around them. It also provides productive instruction time during periods of stasis integrated throughout the process of dyeing.
- See the final project page for her workshop materials and reflection: [Dyeing Textiles with Cochineal - A Short High-School Workshop](/resources/student-projects/sp23_brown-reece_final-project_dye-workshop/).
