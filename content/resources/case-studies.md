# Making and Knowing Resources in Use
The Making and Knowing Project has many collaborators from K-12 to university, to non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions, who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project's methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their syllabi, student projects, and making activities are valuable for those seeking to integrate Making and Knowing resources into their teaching and research.

## Collaborator Pilot Courses
Materials from courses taught by Project collaborators, some using resources from this Companion or developed in consultation with the Making and Knowing Project.

### "Experiment"
Spring 2018, University of Oregon, Clark Honors College

Vera Keller, Professor of History

- ["Experiment" Syllabus](/documents/pdf/sp18_Keller_Vera_syllabus_experiment.pdf) 
- **Course description:** The course *Experiment* explores the origins of experimental science in early modern Europe (15th-18th centuries), and incorporates hands-on activities. In 2018, students researched Ms. Fr. 640 then read essays in *Secrets of Craft and Nature*. The class had the chance to Skype with current and former Making and Knowing students, who were able to answer questions and respond to critiques. The course included a number of experimental reconstructions, including a “Boyle’s Law” demonstration and growing of Seignette Salts. Students described the process of these experiments in a period voice (voice of Boyle or voice of the author-practitioner), and discussed what is at stake in the various literary technologies employed. For more on the various literary technologies, see Vera Keller, [Four Manuscripts between the Recipe and the Experimental Essay](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_320_ie_19).

### ARTH 295: Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World

Spring 2022, Oberlin College

Christina Neilson, Associate Professor of Art History

- [Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World Syllabus](/documents/pdf/sp22_nielson_christina_syllabus-arth-295_ingenious-making_web-version.pdf) (also available as [DOCX](/documents/docx/sp22_nielson_christina_syllabus-arth-295_ingenious-making_web-version.docx))
- **Course description:** This course investigates what it meant to make things and work with materials, including featherwork, imitation gems, color making, and metal casting, in Europe and colonial Latin America between around 1350 and 1650. We will follow historical descriptions and recipes to reconstruct methods of making, and learn from expert practitioners who are holders of traditional techniques and meanings, including indigenous makers. We will consider how a wide range of practitioners developed hands-on knowledge in workshops, laboratories, marketplaces, gardens, etc. and we will explore how making was and is a form of knowledge, how there are different systems of knowledge, and the intersections between art making and science.
- **Reflections on teaching Ingenious Making:** In this video, Christina Neilson and Heather Galloway speak about their experience using the Making and Knowing Project's Hands-on Lesson Plans in a class at Oberlin College.

### VIZA 689: Art/Craft: Hands-on Global Histories of Materials, Techniques, and Skilled Making

Spring 2023, School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts, Texas A&M University

Graduate Special Topics Seminar  

Dr. Tianna Helena Uchacz, Assistant Professor of Art History

- [Art/Craft Syllabus](/documents/pdf/documents/pdf/sp23_uchacz_tianna_syllabus-viza-689_art-craft.pdf)
- **Course description:** This course investigates the materials, techniques, and meanings of craft through hands-on engagement with historical making practices. Classes combine seminar-style discussion of primary sources and contemporary scholarship with site visits and laboratory exercises in making skills, research skills, and writing skills. The course encourages students to consider relationships between making and thinking, nature and artifice, and art/craft and science by exploring issues related to textual, oral, and tacit knowledge, the significance of skill, and global histories of materials, tools, and practice. **In Spring 2023, the Art/Craft seminar will focus on fibers and textiles as case-study materials.**
- **Course Development (Tianna Uchacz):** My aim was to bring the "aha-moments" of M&K's hands-on history of science into an art history seminar. Each class would feature a 40-min discussion of assigned reading followed by a 1-hr hands-on lab. The first decision was to organize the course around a case-study material, and I chose fibers and textiles for the first iteration of this course. I applied for departmental funding to commission workshops from experts in the local [Brazos Spinners and Weavers Guild](https://weavebrazos.org/) to demo table and floor loom weaving (Kay McWilliams), and to instruct in backstrap loom weaving (Toni Wilson), drop-spindle spinning in wool (Debbie Gau) and cotton (Laurie Schlitter), and wet and needle felting (Helen Dewolf). I sought college-level funding to bring M&K's Naomi Rosenkranz to Texas A&M to co-lead workshops on dyeing with cochineal and painting with bioluminescent bacteria (discussed below on this page) in collaboration with a colleague in microbiology, Dr. Donna Janes. Support for this activity, both financial from my own department and in-kind support (lab-space and equipment access) from the Department of Biology, was made possible by opening the activity to faculty and students from across A&M. I then tapped into a variety of A&M's on-campus resources, arranging visits to the [University Art Collections](https://uart.tamu.edu/) to examine Central American textiles, to the [S.M. Tracy Herbarium](https://tracyherbarium.tamu.edu/) to examine samples of vegetal dyestuffs and fibers, to the [Cushing Memorial Library & Archives](https://cushing.library.tamu.edu/) to examine early modern herbals and books on sericulture, to the [Wright Gallery](https://www.arch.tamu.edu/about/facilities/wright-gallery/) to visit an exhibition on tignon head wraps by artist [Chelsea Antoinette](https://cantoinettestudios.com/home.html), and to the [Libraries Preservation Lab](https://library.tamu.edu/research/preservation/index), where my co-instructor Jeanne Goodman led students in activities on rag paper making and mending. Using M&K's skill-building protocols, my students grew [verdigris](/documents/pdf/verdigris_assignment_downloadable_2021.pdf) and then followed medieval Persian recipes to dye paper with verdigris. Drawing on a student reconstruction and essay from M&K's Spring 2017 "Craft and Science" class on [silkworm cultivation](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_059_sp_17), I sourced silkworm eggs from [silkwormshop.com](https://silkwormshop.com/), and students grew silkworms so that we could process cocoons to unravel and reel silk. My colleague Caleb Kicklighter and his student Ryan Applebee gave presentations on approaches to yarn and weave patterns in digital animation. Dr. Sophie Pitman gave excellent suggestions for the reading list and directed me to [HELLO! LOOM](https://helloloom.com/), where I sourced small frame looms for student excercises. Backstrap looms were sourced from [Kakaw Designs](https://kakawdesigns.com/).
- **In sum:** A hands-on seminar such as this takes an extraordinary amount of time and effort to coordinate finding funds, expert sourcing, materials sourcing, logistics, and communication. Although I led the discussion of the readings and oversaw the students' work and evaluation, the lab work was led almost entirely by collaborators. I had limited knowledge of fibers and textiles beforehand, but in organizing and leading this course, I learned as much if not more than the students did. It was an efficient way to deep-dive into materials-based hands-on learning for instructors and students. I have every intention to run future versions of this course that focus on other case-study materials, such as metal, wood, and earth.

### ARTS 150: Global Art History Survey II (Renaissance to Modern)
Texas A&M University

Dr. Tianna Helena Uchacz, Assistant Professor of Art History

- **Course description:** A large lecture survey of architecture, painting, sculpture and the minor arts around the world from the 14th century to the end of the 20th century. ARTS 150 counts toward a Core Curriculum Creative Arts requirement and toward Intercultural Diversity course requirements.
  
#### Honors Section: Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, Spring 2024
In these semesters, students enrolled in the Honors section of Uchacz's ARTS 150 (2–7 students per semester) were invited to complete hands-on activities in the history of artisanal making alongside the regular ARTS 150 coursework (lectures, textbook readings). The honors program encourages high-impact practices that deepen student engagement with course themes and material. Accordingly, Uchacz's students participated in at least three of the following activities, which built on several M&K skill-building activities:
- [Making lake pigments](/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/)
- [Paint making and test-card painting with a variety of binders and hand-made natural pigments](/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_paintingpigments/)
- East Asian brush and ink calligraphy
- Paper marbling
- [Imitation stucco making](/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_stucco/)

#### Scaling Up: Full Class Hands-on Art History, Spring 2024
With support from a [Montague-Center for Teaching Excellence Award](https://pvfa.tamu.edu/news/2023/10/19/uchacz-honored-with-montague-cte-scholars-award-for-development-of-teaching-excellence/), I tested the scalability of M&K's skill-building activities in [making lake pigments](/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/) and [making and testing paints](/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_paintingpigments/) with a class of 60 students in the Renaissance-to-Modern art history survey (75 min class time, Tue & Thu). I divided the class into 2 groups of 30 students, sending half to visit an on-campus art exhibition for an analysis assignment and the other half to the lab.
- Lab 1: Making Lake Pigments
  - [Canvas page for the day's activities](/documents/pdf/sp24_uchacz_tianna_canvas-lab1-arts-150_global-art-history-survey.pdf)
  - 15 stations of students working in pairs across 5 different pigment recipes (cochineal, cochineal reversed, madder, weld, logwood)
  - limiting factor: need for 15 hot plates as well as table space and electrical capacity
  - limiting factor: 75 min can only cover the pigment making, not its rinsing and eventual removal of the filters for drying. Understand that this activity involves additional work for instructors
  - tip: assign students to pairs ahead of class and try to pair a sciences student with an arts student so that at least one person per pair is familiar with lab equipment, lab safety, etc.
  - tip: I used a kettle and two 1.75 L caraffes to pre-boil water in order to reduce activity time spent waiting for water to heat
  - tip: I used stackable cooling racks for baking to help the pigments dry
- Lab 2: Making and Testing Paint
  - [Canvas page for the day's activities](/documents/pdf/sp24_uchacz_tianna_canvas-lab2-arts-150_global-art-history-survey.pdf)
  - 5 stations (tables) of 6 students, where each student has their own glass plate and muller. Each station works with *one* of five pigments made in the previous lab (cochineal, cochineal reversed, madder, weld, logwood), first mulling it in either egg white or egg yolk, and second in either walnut oil or linseed oil. I laid out each station-table according to these templates: first [egg media](/images/sp24_uchacz_tianna_egg-media-arts-150_global-art-history-survey.png), and then [oil media](/images/sp24_uchacz_tianna_oil-media-arts-150_global-art-history-survey.png).
  - limiting factor: need for 30 glass plates and 30 glass mullers as well as table space for this equipment
  - limiting factor: 75 min was barely enough for the seven general stages of this lab: 1) separating eggs and extracting the yolk from the sac, 2) mulling pigment with egg white/yolk, 3) walking around and filling out all 10 sample squares on their card for egg media, 4) washing equipment, 5) mulling pigment with walnut/linseed oil, 6) walking around and filling out all 10 sample squares on their card for oil media, 7) washing up.
  - tip: have students prepare their sample cards ahead of time. Here is the [template](/images/sp24_uchacz_tianna_paint-grid-arts-150_global-art-history-survey.png) I gave them.
  - tip: leave enough time for students to go around the stations to fill in samples of all colors in all media on their cards, but do hurry them along, as they can lose time here.
  - tip: have students take photos of their sample card when they finish, and have ziptop bags on hand into which students can (carefully) place their finished and still-wet sample cards to take home.
  - tip: use cheap paintbrushes (the aim is to create a sample card not a masterpiece), and start with egg media so that the paint brushes can be washed and used again for oil media. Dispose of the paintbrushes after using them with the oil paints.

After each lab, I assigned reflection assignments that asked them to consider contextual information, their experiences in the lab, and the relevance of their experiences for their understanding of art history:
- Pigment-Making Lab Reflection Assignment [[DOCX](/documents/docx/uchacz_2024_lab1_reflection-assignment-background.docx)] [[PDF](/documents/pdf/uchacz_2024_lab1_reflection-assignment-background.pdf)]
- Pigment-Making Lab Reflection Assignment Background Document [[DOCX](/documents/docx/uchacz_2024_lab1_reflection-assignment.docx)] [[PDF](/documents/pdf/uchacz_2024_lab1_reflection-assignment.pdf)]
- Paint-Making Lab Reflection Assignment [[DOCX](/documents/docx/uchacz_2024_lab2_reflection-assignment.docx)] [[PDF](/documents/pdf/uchacz_2024_lab2_reflection-assignment.pdf)]

The results of the reflection assignments were encouraging: the students came to appreciate the material qualities, appearances, and behaviors of various paint media. They gained a better sense of the skill and labor involved in painting, and they had excellent and insightful follow-up questions after the assignment. Moreover, their course evaluations routinely mentioned how much they enjoyed the activity, not only for what they learned but for the opportunity it gave them to get to know their classmates in what is otherwise a sizeable lecture course.

### EAAS W4110: Histories of Science and Technology in East Asia
Spring 2018, East Asian Languages and Cultures, Columbia University

Lan Li, Lecturer & Presidential Scholar in Society and Neuroscience

- [Histories of Science and Technology in East Asia Syllabus](https://edblogs.columbia.edu/hseaw4110-001-2018-1/2017/10/31/hello-world/)
- **Course description:** Students explored what it means for historians to engage in experimentation and the pedagogical value of burning, breaking, and substituting materials. Beyond reading texts, the course also involved a practical component as students engaged with knowledge production by actually making things. This practical assignment, in lieu of a written research paper, was modeled after the Making and Knowing Project. Reconstructions included armillary spheres, techniques for repairing ceramic, and a “simple and convenient x-ray.” The second practical component of the course involved translating broader research questions into a podcast. Podcasts include essays on plastic surgery, mapping mountains, and ritualized cremation. View the projects and podcasts on the [course website](https://edblogs.columbia.edu/hseaw4110-001-2018-1/).
- For Li's reflection on the design and instruction of this course, see her [Introduction](https://edblogs.columbia.edu/hseaw4110-001-2018-1/2018/05/02/introduction/) on the course website.

## Collaborator Workshops

### Bio Art Workshops, School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts, Texas A&M University
Spring 2023
Naomi Rosenkranz, Dr. Tianna Uchacz, Dr. Donna Janes, Dr. Sumeyye Yar

This 4-day workshop was held in March 2023 at Texas A&M University. It was organized by Tianna Uchacz as a series of guest labs for her graduate course, Art/Craft: Hands-on Global Histories of Materials, Techniques, and Skilled Making. The labs were co-led by Naomi Rosenkranz (M&K) and Donna Janes (Microbiology, Texas A&M) in consultation with Sumeyye Yar. The activities, a 2-day dyeing workshop using cochineal insects, paired with a 2-day painting workshop using bioluminescent bacteria, built on workshops that Rosenkranz and Yar had developed and led at Genspace Community Lab, Brooklyn (described below). 10 faculty and 26 students from the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts took part.

This workshop brought together two projects engaged in hands-on reconstruction to exchange methods and experiences on dyeing between the Making and Knowing Project and the [Refashioning the Renaissance](http://refashioningrenaissance.eu/) in March 2019. The Making and Knowing Project and Refashioning the Renaissance experimented with materials commonly used in the early modern period for dyeing red, including the widespread madder, the expensive kermes, and the potent cochineal.

### Genspace Community Science Workshops
#### Coloring Textiles with Bugs: Old (Cochineal) and New (Bacteria)
Naomi Rosenkranz & Dr. Sumeyye Yar, 2018-19

Sponsored by the Center for Science and Society and [Genspace Community Lab](https://www.genspace.org/)

Developed and taught by Sumeyye Yar and Naomi Rosenkranz, a series of workshops were help at Genpace Community Lab in Brooklyn, NY, in May 2018, September 2018, December 2018, and November 2019. Yar and Rosenkranz recieved a Public Outreach grant from Columbia's Center for Science and Society to design and hold workshops exploring colorant sustainability through renewed interest in old methods (dyeing with natural colorants) and new scientific breakthroughs (painting with pigmented bacteria) to combat the pollution and hazards of "fast fashion" and the textile industry. Each workshop was held over two days, 3-4 hours on each day, and combined interactive presentations and discussion, directed making sessions, and open creative time in the lab to create a hybrid textile collage dyed with cochineal dye and printed with pigmented bacteria. In the first offerings, the Public Outreach grant subsidized the cost of participation for students and local residents for expanded impact and reach of the workshops. The workshops were so popular that Genspace asked Yar and Sumeyye to hold additional workshops even after the Public Outreach grant ended and further iterations have been held at Genspace by other instructors. Yar and Rosenkranz have also taken the materials and methodologies developed for these workshops to other settings, courses, and workshops.
 
**Workshop description:** In this hands-on workshop, you will learn both the history and the science of coloring textiles with organisms using historical techniques and new scientific developments. Explore the long tradition of dyeing cloth brilliant shades of red with cochineal insects. Then, discover new cutting-edge techniques of printing textiles with colorful microbes. We will delve into the world of sustainable natural dyes and create artful textile collages.
In this workshop, you will:
- Learn about the history and chemistry of natural colorants and dyes
- Follow 500-year- old recipes from the Renaissance to dye wool and silk yarns with cochineal bugs
- Learn how genetic engineering and bacterial cultures can be used to replace synthetic dyes in the future
- Paint with bacteria and then print your designs on cotton
- At the end, combine your printed microbial designs with your hand-dyed cochineal textiles to create a decorative art piece to take home
No experience in biology, chemistry, dyeing, or colormaking is necessary and all are welcome! Support for this workshop is made possible by a Public Outreach Grant from Columbia University's Center for Science and Society. Tickets are being offered at a subsidized rate for students, artists, and local Sunset Park residents.
