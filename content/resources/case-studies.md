# Making and Knowing Resources in Use
The Making and Knowing Project has many collaborators from K-12 to university, to non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions, who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project's methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their syllabi, student projects, and making activities are valuable for those seeking to integrate Making and Knowing resources into their teaching and research.

## Collaborator Pilot Courses
Materials from courses taught by Project collaborators, some using resources from this Sandbox or developed in consultation with the Making and Knowing Project.

### Spring 2022: ARTH 295 (OC): Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World \[[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQbugAa655DEXQrOFr0M29BK_MCLZEDPdQm8QlQl1M4qkU1Igx9FcP1NkHONbiveQ/pub)\]

Spring 2022
Oberlin College
Professor Christina Neilson, Associate Professor of Art History
- **Course description:** This course investigates what it meant to make things and work with materials, including featherwork, imitation gems, color making, and metal casting, in Europe and colonial Latin America between around 1350 and 1650. We will follow historical descriptions and recipes to reconstruct methods of making, and learn from expert practitioners who are holders of traditional techniques and meanings, including indigenous makers. We will consider how a wide range of practitioners developed hands-on knowledge in workshops, laboratories, marketplaces, gardens, etc. and we will explore how making was and is a form of knowledge, how there are different systems of knowledge, and the intersections between art making and science.
- **Sample student portfolio reports:**
Similar to M&K's [Fieldnotes](https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/), these portfolios document the students' hands-on activities, which included [Stucco for Molding]({{< ref "stucco-assignment" >}}), "Keeping Dry Flowers in the Same State all Year" from the bottom of [folio 120v in BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl), and making and painting [cochineal lake]({{< ref "pigment-cochineal-lake_assignment" >}}) and [verdigris]({{< ref "verdigris-assignment" >}}) pigments.

### Spring 2023: VIZA 689: Art/Craft: Hands-on Global Histories of Materials, Techniques, and Skilled Making [Syllabus]({{< ref "/documents/case-studies/sp23_uchacz_tianna_syllabus-viza-689_art-craft.pdf" >}})

Spring 2023
Graduate Special Topics Seminar, School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts
Texas A&M University
Dr. Tianna Helena Uchacz, Assistant Professor of Art History
- **Course description:** This course investigates the materials, techniques, and meanings of craft through hands-on engagement with historical making practices. Classes combine seminar-style discussion of primary sources and contemporary scholarship with site visits and laboratory exercises in making skills, research skills, and writing skills. The course encourages students to consider relationships between making and thinking, nature and artifice, and art/craft and science by exploring issues related to textual, oral, and tacit knowledge, the significance of skill, and global histories of materials, tools, and practice. 
**In Spring 2023, Art/Craft will focus on fibers and textiles as case-study materials.**
- **Course Development:**
My aim was to bring the "aha-moments" of M&K's hands-on history of science into an art history seminar. Each class would feature a 40-min discussion of assigned reading followed by 1-hr hands on lab. The first decision was to organize the course around a case-study material, and I chose fibers and textiles for the first iteration of this course. I applied for departmental funding to commission workshops from experts in the local [Brazos Spinners and Weavers Guild](https://weavebrazos.org/) to demo table and floor loom weaving (Kay McWilliams), and to instruct in backstrap loom weaving (Toni Wilson), drop-spindle spinning in wool (Debbie Gau) and cotton (Laurie Schlitter), and wet and needle felting (Helen Dewolf). I sought college-level funding to bring M&K's Naomi Rosenkranz to Texas A&M to co-lead workshops on dyeing with cochineal and painting with bioluminescent bacteria (discussed below on this page) in collaboration with a colleague in microbiology, Dr. Donna Janes. Support for this activity, both financial from my own department and in-kind support (lab-space and equipment access) from the Department of Biology, was made possible by opening the activity to faculty and students from across A&M. I then tapped into a variety of A&M's on-campus resources, arranging visits to the [University Art Collections](https://uart.tamu.edu/) to examine Central American textiles, to the [S.M. Tracy Herbarium](https://tracyherbarium.tamu.edu/) to examine samples of vegetal dyestuffs and fibers, to the [Cushing Memorial Library & Archives](https://cushing.library.tamu.edu/) to examine early modern herbals and books on sericulture, to the [Wright Gallery](https://www.arch.tamu.edu/about/facilities/wright-gallery/) to visit an exhibition on tignon head wraps by artist [Chelsea Antoinette](https://cantoinettestudios.com/home.html), and to the [Libraries Preservation Lab](https://library.tamu.edu/research/preservation/index), where my co-instructor Jeanne Goodman led students in activities on rag paper making and mending. Using M&K's skill-building protocols, my students grew [verdigris]({{< ref "/documents/activity-sheets/verdigris_assignment_downloadable_2021.pdf" >}}) and then followed medieval Persian recipes to dye paper with verdigris. Drawing on a student reconstruction and essay from M&K's Spring 2017 "Craft and Science" class on [silkworm cultivation](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_059_sp_17), I sourced silkworm eggs from [silkwormshop.com](https://silkwormshop.com/), and students grew silkworms so that we could process cocoons to unravel and reel silk. My colleague Caleb Kicklighter and his student Ryan Applebee gave presentations on approaches to yarn and weave patterns in digital animation. Dr. Sophie Pitman gave excellent suggestions for the reading list and directed me to [HELLO! LOOM](https://helloloom.com/), where I sourced small frame looms for student excercises. Backstrap looms were sourced from [Kakaw Designs](https://kakawdesigns.com/).
**In sum:** This course took an extraordinary amount of time and effort to coordinate funds-finding, expert sourcing, materials sourcing, logistics, and communication. Although I led the discussion of the readings and oversaw the students' work and evaluation, the lab work was led almost entirely by collaborators. I had limited knowledge of fibers and textiles beforehand, but in organizing and leading this course, I learned as much if not more than the students did. It was an efficient way to deep-dive into materials-based hands-on learning. I have every intention to run future versions of this course that focus on other case-study materials, such as metal, wood, and earth.

### ARTS 150: Global Art History Survey II (Renaissance to Modern)
Texas A&M University
Dr. Tianna Helena Uchacz, Assistant Professor of Art History
- **Course description:** A large lecture survey of architecture, painting, sculpture and the minor arts around the world from the 14th century to the end of the 20th century. ARTS 150 counts toward a Core Curriculum Creative Arts requirement and toward Intercultural Diversity course requirements.
#### Honors Section: Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, Spring 2024
In these semesters, students enrolled in the Honors section of Uchacz's ARTS 150 (2â€“7 students per semester) were invited to complete hands-on activities in the history of artisanal making alongside the regular ARTS 150 coursework (lectures, textbook readings). The honors program encourages high-impact practices that deepen student engagement with course themes and material. Accordingly, Uchacz's students participated in at least three of the following activities, which built on several M&K skill-building activities:
- [pigment making from natural materials]({{< ref "../activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments" >}})
- [paint making and test-card painting with a variety of binders and hand-made natural pigments]({{< ref "../activity-sheets/activitysheet_paintingpigments" >}})
- East Asian brush and ink calligraphy
- paper marbling
- [imitation stucco making]({{< ref "../activity-sheets/activitysheet_stucco" >}})
