## Making Varnishes

The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed varnish recipes several times, both to produce varnishes as ends in themselves and to produce them as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. The manuscript includes several recipes for spirit varnishes, which were a new category of varnish that emerged in the sixteenth century. It also includes several recipes for oil-based varnishes, which have a longer history and are quite dangerous to reconstruct. Accordingly, M&K has developed protocols for making spirit varnishes. Nevertheless, making spirit varnishes raises several safety concerns and may not be suitable for all pedagogical contexts.

### Learning Objectives
The activity of making paint and testing out those paints on a sample card has several potential learning outcomes, which can include:
- learn how paint is made
- exprience how different binders behave during the mulling process
- experience how the mulling of pigments, paint consistency, and specific combinations of pigment and binder affect the application and appearance of paint
- understand material considerations that affect the appearance of artworks across history
