# Tip Sheet for Hands-on Teaching

## Teaching Scenario Building
Hands-on activities are great for teaching and learning scenario building:
- Plan ahead and design the activity
  - write out experiment/activity protocols
  - make sure that the students also write out an experiment protocol, and plan class time to go over these with them
  - think ahead about safety and make sure plans and appropriate equipment are in place. Work with your institution's safety office
  - think ahead and plan for cleanup and waste disposal
 
## Time
  - Hands-on teaching is so much more time-consuming than you can ever imagine
  - Think about and plan minutely for the time you have in one class period
  - Be creative if possible with your institution's course schedule — a four-hour class period is ideal
  - Leave plenty of time for setup and cleanup — ideally, you should try to have your students help with both
  - Make time in class or in the lab/studio for student discussion about their experiences
  - Make time for summary discussion and formulating takeaways
 
## Skill
The Making and Knowing Project team members were almost never expert in the hands-on activities they included in courses.
  - Accustom yourself to not being an expert, but instead, a co-learner. Explore alongside your students
  - Make sure you try the activity before you assign it
  - Have students and instructor(s) work together or in groups — use an "apprenticeship" model, ideally with participants of different skill levels
  - Work around a table or together at a bench so participants can watch each other's process, and discuss and reflect together
  - Bring in "expert practitioners" to your class to help with unfamiliar processes. We often found that the historical processes were a learning experience for expert practitioners as well.

## Recording
- Make sure everyone takes as detailed notes as possible on their process, perhaps by recording on their phones or phone voice-to-text programs (to be transcribed later as lab or field notes)
- Make a template for student lab notes or field notes as a reminder for what needs to be included
- Have the students take plenty of photos as they work (and integrate them later into their lab or field notes or have them create an annotated slide deck/powerpoint in place of lab/field notes)

## Adaptation and Flexibility
- If things don’t go as planned, it’s okay. Sometimes the best learning comes from failure, reflection, and trying again
- This is experimental learning, so process is more important than outcome
- Seek feedback on how to improve the activity, its flow, set up, etc. for next time

## Why devote all this Time and Effort to Hands-On Teaching?
- We have found hands-on activities to be terrifically motivating for students (and instructors), with student creativity and enthusiasm exceeding all expectations
- Students learn to learn in a new way
- New skills will humble and empower your students
- As an instructor, you will learn much about pedagogy, embodied knowledge, yourself, and your students
