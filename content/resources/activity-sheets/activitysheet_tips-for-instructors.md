# Tip Sheet for Hands-on Teaching

- Take plenty of photos
- Make sure everyone takes notes of their process, perhaps by recording on their phones or voice to type on their phones (to be transcribed later as lab or field notes)
- If things don’t go as planned, it’s okay. Sometimes the best learning comes from failure and reflection
- Leave plenty of time for set up and clean up — ideally, you can make time for your students to help with both
- Make sure that you try the activity before you assign it
- This is experimental learning, so process is more important than outcome
- Make time for summary discussion
- Seek feedback on how to improve the activity, its flow, set up, etc. for next time
- Feel free to improvise with the Lesson Plans so that they fit your needs and resources
- Feel free to contextualize the Lesson Plans on this page to suit your course and its learning outcomes
