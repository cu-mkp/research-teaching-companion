# **Historical Culinary Recipe Reconstruction**

{{< figure src="/images/culinaryreconstruction.jpg" alt="Culinary Reconstruction">}}

Cooking is an almost universal activity – it is an art, a craft, a
science – and yet most people do it without categorizing it as such.
Cooking can provide a way for instructors to introduce hands-on
experiments and close textual analysis to their students, many of whom
will be used to following instructions from recipes and may feel more
comfortable engaging in a hands-on activity in a kitchen than a studio,
lab, or classroom. It is also very suitable for at-home assignments, or
in-class activities, as most processes can be conducted in a home or
institutional kitchen.

## Learning Objectives 

The Historical Culinary Recipe activity was conceived as one session at
the start of a semester-long course. INSERT LINK HERE TO SYLLABUS ONCE IT IS IN THE RTC. This assignment works well as a way
into the methodology, but could be expanded into a series of sessions on
different kinds of food, cookbooks across time, or the material culture
and textual world of cookery. It raises questions about tacit knowledge,
the historicity of materials and tools (and how to source them today),
how to adapt protocols and make compromises, what counts as successful
reconstruction, and how hands-on experimentation is a form of close
reading. Encourage your students to work in groups, have them bring
their results to class to eat (if safe!) together as they present their
findings. This is also a wonderful community-building exercise.

## Food in Ms Fr. 640

Ms Fr. 640 only contains a small number of recipes for food (see, for
example “Making *millas*” (fol.
[<u>20r</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/20r/f/20r/tl))
or “Excellent mustard” (fol.
[<u>48r</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48r/f/48r/tl))),
but workshop practice intersects with food and drink on several
occasions. The author-practitioner describes how to taxidermy animals by
drying them in the oven, “after the bread has been taken out,”
suggesting that food preparation took place alongside craft practices
(fol.
[<u>129v</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129v/f/129v/tl)).
He also uses bread as a molding material (fols.
[<u>140v</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl)
and
[<u>156r</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl))
and as an ingredient in making black varnish (fol.
[<u>4v</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl)).
In the early modern period, food was always considered as adjacent to
medicine. To avoid suffering from inhaling toxic fumes when making
silver run, the author-practitioner advises to “take in the morning good
buttered toast, and hold the said butter, or zedoary, or gold coins, in
your mouth, and cover your face with a cloth from the eyes down” (fol.
[<u>123v</u>](http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl)).

## Themes

Embodied knowledge, the body and the senses, historical reconstruction
(especially questions of historical “authenticity”), everyday life,
food, material culture, craft, medicine.

## Teaching Materials

Student activity sheet

Guide to historical recipes and collections

## Finding Recipes

If you are working with advanced students, such as graduate students or specialist undergraduates, we recommend you invite your students to explore the resources suggested
in the above “Guide to historical recipes and collections” and select a
recipe themselves. However, if working with less experienced students, you may wish to offer them a few suggestions. 
We encourage you to see whether your institution has
any manuscript or printed recipe collections in the library; this could
be an opportunity to take your students to work with primary sources
available on campus.

## Sourcing Materials

One of the key challenges in this assignment is to source ingredients
and processes that closely resemble or emulate historical ones. This
inevitably involves compromises, and raises productive questions about
what historical “authenticity” actually means and to what extent it is
attainable in historical reconstructions.

If you can, provide your students with a small budget and ask them to
source their own ingredients. They may come up with novel solutions to
material sourcing challenges, which prompts great in-class discussions.

## Discussion Questions:

-   How did you source ingredients? Did you have to make compromises?
    Did you have to research any words?

-   What was missing from your recipe? Did it contain enough information
    for you to follow step-by-step, or did you need to make some
    interventions or fill in gaps?

-   What research questions did this process raise for you?

-   What might this suggest about the intended reader of this book?

-   What can this tell us about food / cooking / a specific material or
    process from the past?
