# Historical Culinary Recipe Reconstruction – Student Activity Sheet

Do the required reading and watching **before** you start your
reconstruction. Explore and use the websites listed here to search for
comparable recipes in contemporaneous sources.

## Required Reading/Watching/Listening (do this first)

-   Ken Albala, “Cooking as Research Methodology: Experiments in
Renaissance Cuisine,” *Renaissance Food from Rabelais to
Shakespeare: Culinary Readings and Culinary Histories*, ed. Joan
Fitzpatrick (Aldershot, UK: Ashgate, 2010), pp. 73–88.

-   [Syrup of Violets and Science](http://youtu.be/pdEbMBe0aa8) video (ca 8 mins).

-   ["The Best Medicine"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/best-medicine) RadioLab podcast (ca. 30 mins).

## Choosing a recipe

Choose a recipe from any historical source. You can start your search
with this [list of historical recipes and recipe collections.](/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_hcr-historical-recipe-collection/)

Keep in mind that we are more interested in your process than your
finished product (although if it is delicious, all the better!) so do
choose a recipe that you find intriguing rather than one you think will
be easy to execute (in any case, processes which seem simple often turn
out to be more complicated than they appear).

Work with a partner to cook a dish based on a historical recipe. As much
as possible, try to simulate early modern ingredients, apparatus, and
methods.

-   Some recipes calling for a large amount of ingredients may need to
be halved or quartered.

-   If necessary, please refrigerate perishable items in airtight
containers (which is historically anachronistic, but bacteria do
not care about anachronism or historical accuracy!).

-   Document the details of the cooking process in order to give a short
10-minute presentation with your partner in class. The means by
which you document and present is up to you and your partner, but
feel free to make use of photos, video, audio, notes, PowerPoint,
YouTube, Prezi, etc.

-   Take lots of photographs during the process!



**Questions and Food for Thought**

-   Think carefully about the ingredients and processes. Check the OED
(*Oxford English Dictionary*) for the early modern meanings of
familiar and unfamiliar terms (for a familiar term that has a
different meaning in an earlier period, see “biscuits”). NB. The OED requires a subscription. Check if your institution or local library has one.

-   Are these ingredients comparable to modern ingredients? How are they
similar or different? What about their purity? Were they unusual
(and perhaps imported) or common? Were they expensive at the time?
What compromises will you have to make in sourcing ingredients?

-   What about your modern heating apparatus and cookware, how might
this impact authenticity? Could your pots, pans, ladles, ovens,
and heating elements change the outcome of a recipe?

-   What tacit information has been left out of your recipe? What did
you do in your reconstruction that was not discussed by the
original author?

-   Who wrote your recipe? Why did he or she write it down and/or
publish it?

-   Who might have formed the audience for your recipe? Can you identify
whether they were part of a particular social group? Does your
recipe contain any hints about power dynamics or social structure?
