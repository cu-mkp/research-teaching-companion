## Making Inks

The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed inks several times, both as products and as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. While the manuscript is itself written in iron gall ink (the "common" black writing ink of the Renaissance), it does not include any writing ink recipes. Learning about and making writing inks can thus shed light on the history and materiality of texts. Because of their relatively simple ingredients and the speed and ease of their making, writing inks are an excellent hands-on activity for beginners and experts alike. The activity can be done in small groups, as a demonstration for a larger audience, or as part of a deeper personal exploration of the materials. 

### Learning Objectives
The activity of making inks has several potential learning outcomes, which can include:
- examine historical inks, focusing on the two most important black writing inks: carbon inks and iron gall inks
- learn what inks are made of and how to make them
- explore the ways that carbon and iron gall inks flow, bleed, and bead on various supports 
- appreciate the material properties of historical writing materials affect their making and their afterlives

### What is an Ink?
Writing inks are a colored viscous fluid composed of a water-based liquid, a binding agent, and a colorant. Inks are often liquid, but can also come in the form of pastes, cakes, and sticks.

#### Inks in Ms. Fr. 640
There are dozens of entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that address the making and use of varnishes. In fact, "varnish" is one of the categories that M&K has used to classify the various entries in the manuscript, and entries on varnishes account for roughly 5% of the manuscript's contents. These entries can be accessed through the "varnish" category filter in the [List of Entries](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries) and by a wildcard search for "[varnish\*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search?q=varnish*)" to catch all instances of the term in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/).


There are also several essays in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) that explore inks in detail, including:
- Raymond Carlson, Jordan Katz, and Baris Gokturk, “[Molding Paper with Raised Letters](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_005_fa_14).”
- Olivia Clemens, “[Sulfuric Acid for the Scribe](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_044_sp_16).”
