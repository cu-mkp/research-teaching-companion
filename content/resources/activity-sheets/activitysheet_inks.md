## Making Inks

The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed varnish recipes several times, both as products and as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. The manuscript includes several recipes for spirit varnishes, which were a new category of varnish that emerged in the sixteenth century. It also includes several recipes for oil-based varnishes, which have a longer history and are quite dangerous to reconstruct and often result in fires. Accordingly, M&K is only sharing protocols for making spirit varnishes. Nevertheless, making spirit varnishes raises several safety concerns and may not be suitable for all pedagogical contexts.


### Learning Objectives
The activity of making inks has several potential learning outcomes, which can include:
- learn what varnish is, what it is made of, and how it is made
- exprience how various resins behave and appear in different alcohol and volatile oil solvents
- understand how qualities such as viscosity were communicated through historical artisanal shorthands such as the "knife test"
- explore the range of visual effects created by varnishes 
- understand material considerations that affect the appearance of artworks across history

#### Inks in Ms. Fr. 640
There are dozens of entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that address the making and use of varnishes. In fact, "varnish" is one of the categories that M&K has used to classify the various entries in the manuscript, and entries on varnishes account for roughly 5% of the manuscript's contents. These entries can be accessed through the "varnish" category filter in the [List of Entries](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries) and by a wildcard search for "[varnish\*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search?q=varnish*)" to catch all instances of the term in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/).


There are also several essays in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) that explore inks in detail, including:
- Raymond Carlson, Jordan Katz, and Baris Gokturk, “[Molding Paper with Raised Letters](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_005_fa_14).”
- Olivia Clemens, “[Sulfuric Acid for the Scribe](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_044_sp_16).”
