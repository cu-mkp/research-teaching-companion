## Lake Pigments

### Lake pigments and natural colorants

Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources. As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. These colorants must therefore be extracted and then made insoluble in order to use them as pigments.

**Lake pigments:** in general, pigments prepared from soluble natural colorants, formed by precipitating (or adsorbing) the dye onto a colorless or white, insoluble, relatively inert substrate.

### Pigments

Pigments are colored, insoluble particles that, when combined with a binding medium, create paint that can then be applied to a substrate. Historically, most pigments were sourced from the natural environment, including from plants, insects, stones, and dirt. Since the eighteenth century, the synthesis of pigments in industrial settings has become very common, ensuring consistent quality and new formulations.

Pigments are most often encountered as a component of paint. In short: Pigment + Binding Media = Paint

### Natural Pigments

In general, there are three broad categories of natural pigments:
- mineral: from mineral ores, semi-precious stones, and even gemstones.
- earth: from special types of colored dirt (**NJR FIX THIS!!!**). These are also, technically, a form of mineral pigment.
- organic: from plants and animal sources. Lake pigments fall under this category.


### Historical Recipes for Lake Pigments

There are numerous recipes in historical sources from the late medieval period onward for making lake pigments. These include:
- Cennino Cennini, _Il Libro dell'Arte_(_The Craftsman's Handbook_)
- Various manuscript sources compiled in Mary P. Merrifield, _Medieval adn Renaissance Treatises on the Arts of Painting_

A particularly readable example is taken from the so-called "Paduan Manuscript," given in Mary P. Merrifield, _Medieval and Renaissance Treatises on the Arts of Painting: Original Texts with English Translations_ (1849, Dover Publications, 1969), pp. 701-702.

>_Un altra sorte di lacca fina._ - R. Piglia 12 grani di cocciniglia, o grana fina fatta inpolvere, si pone in due oncie di lissivio lasciandola in infusione due hore incirca poi si cola per pano lino, e si mette sopra cenere calda, quando vorrà bollire vi si aggiunge quanto due piselli d&#39;allume di rocca in polvere, quando il liscivo farà schiuma grossa incarnata all&#39; hora si getta tutto in un panno lino steso, e passarà il lissivo chiaro restando la schiuma nel panno, quale si fa seccare, e si fa tavolette.

> _Another sort of fine lake._ Take 12 grains of powdered cochineal or fine grana, add to it 2oz of ley; leave the infusion for about 2 hours; strain it through a linen cloth and put it over hot cinders; When it boils add to it pulverized roche alum of the size of 2 peas then the ley will make a thick red scum; as soon as this happens throw it all onto a stretched linen cloth, when the clear ley will pass through leaving the coagulum on the cloth, which coagulum must afterwards be dried and made into tablets.


Such historical recipes have been updated so that they can be made in the modern lab or kitchen. For modernized recipes, see Jo Kirby et al, _Natural Colorants for Dyeing and Lake Pigments: Practical Recipes and their Historical Sources_ (Archetype, London, 2014), chapter 5.

The basic steps involved in making lake pigments are:

1)	extract a colorant from a plant or insect by crushing it and soaking it in water
2)	add either A) an acid or B) a base to that colored water and heat it for a time, the better to extract the color
3)	catalyze a chemical reaction by adding either A) a base to your acidic solution or B) an acid to your basic solution (i.e., make a “volcano” reaction)
4)	let the reaction settle and then pour the solution through a filter; a precipitate will be left behind in the filter
5)	rinse the precipitate one or two more times until the water runs clear
6)	let it dry and scrape it from the filter. This is your pigment.

### To teach lake pigments using Ms. Fr. 640

There are no recipes for making lake pigments in Ms. Fr. 640. There are, however, numerous references to lake pigments across the manuscript.
