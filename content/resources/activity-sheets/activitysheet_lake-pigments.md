## Lake Pigments

### Lake pigments and natural colorants

Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources. As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. These colorants must therefore be extracted and then made insoluble in order to use them as pigments.

**Lake pigments:** in general, pigments prepared from soluble natural colorants, formed by precipitating (or adsorbing) the dye onto a colorless or white, insoluble, relatively inert substrate.

### Pigments

Pigments are colored, insoluble particles that, when combined with a binding medium, create paint that can then be applied to a substrate. Historically, most pigments were sourced from the natural environment, including from plants, insects, stones, and dirt. Since the eighteenth century, the synthesis of pigments in industrial settings has become very common, ensuring consistent quality and new formulations.

In the context of Ms. Fr. 640, pigments are most often encountered as components of paint. In short:
Pigment + Binding Media = Paint

### Natural Pigments

In general, there are three broad types of natural pigments: mineral, earth, and organic. Mineral pigments typically come from mineral ores, semi-precious stones, and even gemstones. Their color is a function of their particular metal content
