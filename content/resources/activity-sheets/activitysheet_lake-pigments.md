## Lake Pigments

### Lake pigments and natural colorants

Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources. As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. These colorants must therefore be extracted and then made insoluble in order to use them as pigments.

**Lake pigments:** in general, pigments prepared from soluble natural colorants, formed by precipitating (or adsorbing) the dye onto a colorless or white, insoluble, relatively inert substrate.
