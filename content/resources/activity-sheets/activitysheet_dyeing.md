### Dyeing with natural colorants

If you are not already familiar with historical dyes and natural colorants, refer to the [Presentation: Cochineal Dye: History, Chemistry, and Preparation](/documents/activity-sheets/2023_dyes_cochineal-history-chem-prep.pdf) for more complete information and further explanation of natural colorants and dyeing.

A dye is "a compound that absorbs into and colors another material" and "is generally a complex organic material" ([Conservation and Art Materials Encyclopedia Online (CAMEO)](http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Dye)). Until the onset of synthetic dyes in the mid-nineteenth century, most dyes were sourced from natural colorants such as plants, insects, lichens, and shellfish. 

In order to dye materials (typically textiles, but also wood, paper, and ivory, for example), the natural colorant must first be extracted from the dyestuffs (the plant, insect, etc.). This is most usually done by placing the dyestuffs in water and using either time (soaking) or heat (bringing to a simmer) to extract the soluble colorant into the water. The materials can then be placed into this dye bath to take on color.

Natural dyes can be categorized into one of three processes used to extracted the colorant and dye materials : 
1. Direct dyes
2. Mordant dyes
3. Vat dyes

### Mordant dyes
The largest class of natural dyes is mordant dyes. In this process, textiles must first be treated with a mordant (typically a metal salt or coordination metal) in order to bind the dye more permanently to the textile. The textile binds to the mordant which in turn binds to the colorant. The mordant thus acts as a bridge between the textile and colorant.

The most common mordant is aluminum, typically in the form of alum (aluminum potassium sulfate). Other mordants include iron sulfate, copper sulfate, and tannins.
