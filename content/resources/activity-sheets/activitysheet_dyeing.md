## Dyeing

### Dyeing with natural colorants

Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources. As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. To be used as a pigment,
these colorants must therefore be extracted as a solulble dye and then made insoluble by precipitating (or adsorbing) the dye onto a colorless or white, insoluble, relatively inert substrate.
