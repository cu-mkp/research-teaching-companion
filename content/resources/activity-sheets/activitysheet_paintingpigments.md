## Painting Pigments


### What is Paint?
Paint = pigment + binder

#### Pigments
Pigments are colored, insoluble particles that, when combined with a binding medium, create paint that can then be applied to a substrate. Historically, most pigments were sourced from the natural environment, including from plants, insects, stones, and dirt. Since the nineteenth century, the synthesis of pigments in industrial settings has become very common, ensuring consistent quality and new formulations.

#### Binders
Binders are materials that bring cohesion and unity to particulate matter. In the case of paint, binders are what turn powdered pigment into a viscous material that can be applied to a substrate such that it adheres. Binders for paint are divided into two main categories:
- water-based (aqueous): egg yolk, egg white, various gums
- oil-based: linseed oil, walnut oil, waxes, resins

#### Mulling
Mulling is a mechanical process used to thoroughly combine a pigment with a binder. It involves grinding the pigment and binder together on a hard surface, often a glass plate or marble slab, using a muller--a pestle-like, flat-bottomed tool, often made of glass. There are various techniques for manipulating the muller on the plate that can facilitate the process of paint-making, such as moving the muller in a figure-8 pattern or in a series of small circles moving around in a larger circle. In all cases, pressure must be applied to the muller in order to help grind the pigment particles into the binder. Most paints require that the pigments be mulled so that no further particles are visible or, put differently, so that the resultant paint is smooth.

#### Support
Paint is applied to a variety of supports, including canvas, panel, paper, and metal, just to name a few.
