# Discussion Document

nb. These are real, unedited, student comments. This document is
shared to give you a sense of the kinds of responses this activity can
elicit. Names have been redacted.

- **STUDENT A**– One thing that stuck out to me throughout our recipe
  reconstructions was the frustration of vague instructions - what
  does “a large quantity of water” mean? What does it mean to
  prepare something “as beforehand”? Many of us discussed how these
  unclear instructions point to a learning based on personal
  interaction with more-experienced neighbors, friends, or
     superiors, and on past experience, rather than merely on textual
    instruction. This learning experience isn’t unique to the early
    modern period. I personally was reminded of my family’s recipes
    that have been photocopied and passed down by my grandmother,
    which she collected from her own mother, her old church friends,
    her old neighbors, and her own experience cooking for our family.
    I’ve long been frustrated by her lack of specificity - in her
    bread recipe, for example, a range of yeast quantities is given,
    and I always have to call my mom to ask what I should do.
    Community-based learning never disappeared, but there’s no place
    for it in cookbooks and published works. When did culinary
    instruction start to require formality and specificity? And, more
    importantly, why? My first instinct is that it may relate to
    industrialization and the valorization of regularity and
    uniformity. But natural ingredients and processes can’t be reduced
    to uniform experience, as we all know from our experiments. This
    reconstruction was a reminder that embodied knowledge is as
    important as, and at times more useful than, scientific knowledge.

-   **STUDENT B** – This learning experience made me so grateful to live
    in an age of clean tap water, electricity, abundant kitchen
    appliances and having the internet to consult at our finger tips.
    I imagine people in the 17<sup>th</sup> century had to make a lot
    of effort for things we take for granted now. One of the
    classmates was talking about how smashing up the almonds being so
    laborious and the smashing noise was so annoying. Now we can find
    almond grinded up ready-made but in the 17<sup>th</sup> century
    this was a backbreaking process. Another classmate said they had
    to keep the stove on for 6 hours, so if this was to be converted
    to 17<sup>th</sup> century time, it must have taken many days to
    make it. I will be mindful of these conveniences while recreating
    medieval recipes.

-   **STUDENT C** — When thinking about recreating a 16th century
    recipe, the first assumption we make is that there lies a drastic
    difference between the past and the present. In return, we ought
    to get something quite different from the 16th century product.
    However, such assumption can't stand because there are no clear
    indications of what the actual product should look like or taste
    like. We are fanaticizing a vision of the final product based on
    our temporal knowledge. Then, how do we know if we failed or
    succeeded in reconstructing a historical culinary recipe? (we are
    uncertain if the desired consistency the recipe described is what
    we expect within today’s context) Since most things we encounter
    today are standardized, we are expecting to make similar products
    out of the same recipe (contemporary recipe). Anything deviating
    from the paradigm is considered a mistake or failure. On the
    contrary, back in the 16th and 17th centuries, things were not
    standardized, so there could be more room for free explorations
    and "errors." Furthermore, there are no photos of the "correct
    product" to compare with or videos of the making process to
    follow. I want to bring up another question: if we have the exact
    same ingredients, utensils, kitchen setup, and climate, can we
    reconstruct the same product? Probably not. These historical
    recipes were accompanied by the transmission of embodied knowledge
    of the time, and we don’t inherit that knowledge of bodily
    transmission today. The main takeaway for me is not just how we
    should be aware of the difference between the past and present,
    but also how we should be mindful of the limitations of texts and
    the gap between textual languages and bodily languages.

-   **STUDENT D** – The first thing that struck me about our recipe (a
    syrup for the stomach) is how simple it sounds to modern readers:
    a drink made of oranges, lemons, pomegranates, and rose water
    would hardly be regarded as anything medicinal today. No doctor
    would prescribe it as a treatment; it would at best be part of a
    suggested diet, like herbal infusions against colds or rice for
    digestion issues. For this reason, many, even among practitioners
    of historical culinary reconstructions, describe this kind of
    recipes as “grandma’s remedies”. Its authorship suggests quite the
    contrary: it was written by an important noblewoman, Lady Arundel,
    and before she even turned 22. Our modern conceptions of what
    “popular” and “high” cuisine or medicine mean are misleading when
    transported to the 17<sup>th</sup> century: the potential audience
    of a manuscript book of recipes were exclusively women of the
    high-class in a society where female literacy was still a
    privilege of the few. This drink had no chance of being ordinary
    and isn’t part of some sort of popular, folkloristic knowledge. It
    also shows to what extent we have come to disregard the medicinal
    properties of common food: when looking for a cure, most of us
    turn towards the pharmaceutical industry. Around 1600, on the
    contrary, there was no clear divide between pharmacy and cuisine:
    food could also be used to cure diseases. But not every kind of
    food: another point of interest with the reconstruction was to
    realize that very common ingredients today were in fact, if not
    properly exotic, at least quite rare in early modern England.
    Mediterranean citrus fruits were not accessible to the majority
    and weren’t part of the common diet: their relative strangeness
    rendered possible the assignment of medical qualities to them.
    People, today as in the past, tend to distrust ordinary products
    when it comes to dealing with disturbances of their ordinary state
    of health. But this is not enough to say that the products’ status
    has changed: they are organically different. Even after historical
    sourcing, it is almost impossible to have 17<sup>th</sup>-century
    fruits and sugar in 21<sup>st</sup>-century United States or
    Europe. One should undergo the process not only of reconstructing
    cooking, but also of reconstructing agriculture to really recreate
    what a syrup would taste and look like 400 years ago. It is
    telling of how much technology and the food industry have
    transformed the world we live in.

-   **STUDENT E** — Recreating this historical recipe made me hyper
    aware of all of the specialized cooking and baking tools we use
    today and forced me to think about when they were created.
    Obviously everything that exists was created at some point, but I
    think we take things like whisks, beaters, and graters for granted
    because they have been around for so long. Being forced to cook
    without these specialized tools, especially when making recipes
    that may still exist today which we may be used to making with
    these specialized tools, gave me a new appreciation for the tools
    and made me think about who came up with the idea for them, how,
    and when. I also thought about the difference in the ingredients
    used and whether this had an effect on the method of preparing
    them. Perhaps as the ingredients changed and evolved, so did the
    methods of preparing them, and new tools were necessary to
    accommodate these evolving methods. In any case, the lack of such
    specialized tools makes me think about the concept of “master”
    chefs and the weight the word held in the 15th century as opposed
    to today. Without an internet to consult, photos to work from, or,
    indeed, specialized tools that would make labor-intensive culinary
    jobs easier, faster, or less complicated, achieving such high
    honors would have been a much more demanding accomplishment.

<!-- -->

-   **STUDENT F** – Recreating this recipe took my mind to a whole new
    place. When thinking about past times, we don't always put into
    perspective that real people lived these lives. We get so caught
    up in the mythical and playful stories of these periods that it
    does not cross our minds that real times call for real measures,
    and we see that reflected perfectly in these recipes. Reading
    these recipes, I noticed a lightheartedness to everything—nothing
    too strict or demanding. Due to the tone and how the language was
    set up, I also felt that you need prior knowledge of many of these
    dishes to recreate, which has me thinking. Back in the 15 century,
    not all would be taking on the role of cooking, so there was never
    a need to fully explain what exactly needed to be used or done
    because those involved in cooking would already have background,
    knowledge, and context on a lot of these things. It was also
    really humbling to see how work-intensive these things are, from
    the type of ingredients to preparation to even making the tools. I
    am forever grateful to be born in a generation where things are so
    much easier and accessible.

-   **STUDENT G** – During the culinary reconstruction of the plum
    candy/cake recipe, I kept thinking about how pure contemporary
    ingredients/processes are compared to those in 17th-century
    Europe - particularly with sugar. The goal of my reconstruction
    was to recreate the final finished product. While the rebuilding
    was ultimately a failure, it gave insight into what the original
    recipe crafters would have had in mind. My biggest question was
    about thickening the product so that it may gel. Modern recipes
    would have added gelatin or corn syrup, but without those, I would
    have imagined the impurities in early sugar production would have
    led to a thickened product. Modern refined sugar was missing some
    agent that allowed the product to concentrate correctly. The
    instructions were not overly complicated, but we could have
    skipped several steps. We didn’t need to reboil the syrup, which I
    believed was a step to remove impurities, nor did we have to
    “beat” the sugar, given modern kitchen appliances that could do it
    faster and to a greater degree. I imagined the outcome to be a
    plum candy, either jelly in nature or maybe even hard candy.
    Without modern tools like thermometers and electric heating
    apparatuses with temperature control, the ancient recipe makers
    must have been skilled not to allow the sugar to scorch or burn. I
    would like to try this recipe again, but working backward from a
    modern version. I would likely have to use more coats or unrefined
    ingredients like pure cane sugar and strain the particulates
    through a cheesecloth or similar. I would also have to let the
    product boil on a lower heat for longer to reduce the water
    content and allow it to concentrate. I would also try pouring the
    thickened product onto a baking sheet to cool and firm up
    properly. The actual historical question I would have is purely
    about the culinary evolution of food through ancient Europe. Given
    the scarcity of resources, how did these cooks and gourmets evolve
    their cooking methods to create a refined dish?

-   **STUDENT H** – As I reflect on our candied plums project, I have
    come to appreciate the significance of historical context in
    shaping the outcome of our experiment. Although we were unable to
    achieve the desired results, the experience has shed light on
    several important considerations that were not initially taken
    into account. One of the main challenges we faced was the authenticity of the
    ingredients used. In our quest to recreate the traditional recipe, we
    neglected to match the type of plums that would have been used in the
    16th or 17th century. Additionally, the scarcity of sugar at the time,
    particularly in its refined form, may have impacted the end product.
    Furthermore, our decision to include water in the mixture was not
    well-informed and may have led to inconsistencies in our results.

    Overall, our project highlighted the complexities involved in
    recreating historical recipes. The seemingly straightforward task of
    making candied plums was much more nuanced than we anticipated.
    Nevertheless, the lessons learned from this experience have given us a
    deeper appreciation for the craftsmanship and attention to detail
    required to preserve traditional recipes. The benefits of using
    storytelling as a form of spiritual teaching can also be applied to
    the preservation of traditional culinary practices. The intricacies
    and complexities of these recipes serve as a testament to the value
    placed on them and the importance of preserving the historical context
    of the recipes.

-   **STUDENT I** – The variety of recipes presented in class
    illuminated how intention shapes reflection. Some groups chose
    recipes that sought to elicit aesthetic effects, others chose
    medicinal recipes. These different aspirations necessitated a
    different end to experimental practice. For instance, each
    ingredient within the medicinal recipes served a specific purpose
    that cured or alleviated a negative symptom associated with a
    particular sickness, such as fruit juice or sugar combined into a
    tincture. The product was evaluated based on whether or not it
    would achieve its purpose as a medicine, and different
    modifications were sometimes suggested for future trials. In
    contrast, those who made decorative foods understood ingredients
    as materials for artisanal production, forming marble from flowers
    or sugared snow to adorn rosemary. My group created candied
    rosemary, which required us to manipulate the sugar to create a
    desired decorative effect––much of our interpretation and
    experimentation sought to resolve uncertainty around the
    consistency of the sugared product. In the end, our intention was
    to ensure that the end product would look and seem appropriate
    when put on rosemary. If I were to make this once more, I would
    feel more confident and secure in the boiling of the sugar, for
    now I know how it behaves physically when it grows cold.

-   **STUDENT J**– In recreating the historic recipe chosen by my group,
    I was struck by how easy it was not only to understand the
    instruction but to recreate it. Much of this was due to the
    readily available nature of our ingredients: lemons, pomegranates,
    oranges and sugar, with the most challenging one to source being
    the rose water. In addition to the ease of acquiring the
    ingredients, the processes of extraction and measuring were fairly
    straightforward, albeit vague at times in their wording (ie.
    spoonful). In class, when we went through other groups'
    presentations of their recreations, I noticed that those who also
    chose to do medicinal recipe reconstructions found their processes
    similarly uncomplicated. In contrast, I noticed that the groups
     who chose culinary recipes and recipes for garnishes faced many
    more challenges not only in terms of the process of reconstruction
    but also in the appearance of their end results, like in the case
    of the candied rosemary. It was interesting to look at this
    variety of recipes side by side, revealing the spectrum of what
    was considered a recipe in 14th century Europe and emphasizing the
    blurred nature of the lines between medicine and cooking at the
    time. I think it is also interesting to consider that the recipes
    like the stomach medicine recreated by my group may have been more
    undemanding because they fell into the category of what we might
    call “home remedies” and would therefore be more accessible to the
    common man rather than the culinary recipes which may have been
    geared towards a “finer” and more specifically skilled audience.

-   **STUDENT K**– De Mayerne’s recipes have an overriding interest for
    the visual appearance of products. This is why we got interested
    in his recipes in the first place. I wondered how far his interest
     in synesthesia has its roots in early modern discussions about
    perception and qualities of things. Also, his interest for the
    visual appearance of culinary products draws artisanal work and
    cookery closer. In another recipe, De Mayerne uses the word
    “varnish” to describe a topping that is distributed over pastries.
    The marble imitation, that is the main intention of our recipe,
    has a long tradition in the history of art. In painted forms (e.g.
    in cinquecento painting) and later in actual material imitation
    (scagliola). I wondered how far this accounts for a proximity
    between the two fields of practices. It remains a question to me,
    how these fields communicated and what the modus of reception is
    (e.g. humorous?).

    In our first meeting, we researched the products we needed. It took us
    some research to find a place where we could buy the edible flowers
    (Eataly). The gum dragon, on the other hand, was easier to acquire. As
    a powdered and highly processed product, we were skeptical whether it
    fits the seventeenth-century expectation of a binder. Although most
    ingredients for cooking were expensive to acquire in early modern
    Europe, the recipe seemed rather imprecise. Why not give a more
    detailed description of the procedure? Did the potential reader have a
    good basic knowledge of cooking and preparing (similar dishes) that
    did not necessitate any detailed explanation? The recipe did not
    indicate the amount of any of the ingredients (petals, sugar, gum
    dragon). We wondered how these ingredients should create a paste,
    since none of them was a liquid. Were the petals alone supposed to add
    the necessary moisture? Since De Mayerne used the term “paste”, we
    asked ourselves whether the recipe indicated a pre-made product that
    we would add the other ingredients to. Since our first paste
    significantly lacked moisture, we tried to add a little bit of water
    and it worked well. In our last experiment, however, we used more
    petals instead of adding any water, and the paste got even better than
    the first one. I was surprised how well the experiment turned out. The
    instructions seem scarce, nevertheless the product is easy to make—a
    dissonance that a lot of us seem to ponder.

-   **STUDENT L** – To start with, the writing style and language used
    in the 16th century are different from modern English, and it
    requires a familiarity with the historical context of the time
   period. I found it weird that some letters look different, like
    the “s.” At the same recipe I executed, it was written in two
    different ways. Second, in the 16th century, certain raw materials
    may take different forms, textures, and colors, leading to
    differences in the final products. This can affect the outcome of
    recipes, as the materials used will impact the flavor and
    appearance of the finished product. It may be difficult to find or
    replicate the exact materials used in the 16th century, and
    substitutions may need to be made based on what is available now.
    Third, there is a difference in quantities and measurements used
    in that time period compared to modern units, which can make it
    challenging to understand recipes or instructions. In some cases,
    a conversion is needed with the help of historical sources to
    understand the equivalent in contemporary terms. Additionally, the
    precision and consistency of measurements may not have been as
    exact in the past, so even if the recipes were followed exactly.
    So, sometimes educated guesses or estimates are needed based on
    the available information available.

<!-- -->

-   **STUDENT M –** While recreating the recipe for the candied rosemary
    with my group, it only reinforced the importance of
    experimentation in the realm of cooking, especially when there is
    little information given about time, quantity, etc. Though, even
    when some of these details are given, one still has to
    “experiment” and rely on qualitative elements. For instance, for
    the candied rosemary reconstruction, they did not provide a ratio
    for the amount of rose water and sugar that was needed for syrup
    but instead mentioned that we should use “a little” rose water and
    described the syrup as “loose.” So, it was up to our discretion to
    determine which conditions would satisfy those descriptions. For
    instance, though, what we could determine is whether the syrup
    would stick and stay on the candied rosemary (instructions that
    were not provided). First, our syrup was too thin and did not
    stick, but then we changed our ratio of 1 to 2 for rose water to
    sugar and the syrup hardened onto the rosemary. So, it was through
    observation and experimentation that we were able to successfully
    come to a desired product. I will eventually have to apply this
    openness to change and creativity when making sourdough bread and
    bread molds.

    One question I had was how these people could communicate these
    tricks, especially when the manuscripts were sometimes vague. I
    understand that they were orally passed down, but I am wondering if
    there were different get-togethers where people would bring their
    food, medications, etc., and have people try them. Essentially, I am
    curious about a communal element and would like to look into that
    further.

-   **STUDENT N** – Having reflected on my group’s own experience
    performing the almond custard recipe in Robert May’s *The
    Accomplisht Cook* and the presentations of other groups, I’m
    interested in the sheer number of ways that the language of an
    early modern recipe can pose interpretive problems for the modern
    reader. In our recipe alone, we faced both lexical and syntactical
    issues in what at first seemed to us to be a readily
    understandable set of instructions. The most ostensible challenge
    is the denotative problem of identifying the correct early modern
    definition for a word, especially if such a definition has fallen
    into disuse; the word “beat” in our recipe has two culinary
    meanings, either “to mix (liquids) by beating with a stick or
    other instrument” (most commonly for eggs” or “to make into a
    powder or paste by repeated blows” (*OED*). The first definition
    seems more colloquially used in cooking contexts today, but the
    second definition is most applicable for our recipe. Another
    potential pitfall lies in words that have only slightly altered
    their meanings over time; it’s easy to assume that units of
    measure have stable meanings, but the societal push to standardize
    such units was often a modern occurrence. For example, in our
    recipe, the word “pound” has denoted different weights in
    different historical moments and only achieved a somewhat
    standardized, state-issued meaning of sixteen ounces in the
    fourteenth century (*OED*). However, it is not only the
    definitions of words that can pose interpretive challenges but
    also the foundational grammar of a recipe. After “beating” the
    almonds into a paste, we faced considerable confusion from the
    following instruction: “*strain them with* two quarts of cream,
    twenty whites of eggs, and a pound of double refined sugar.” While
    the need to strain the almond paste was clear, the exact method of
    doing so was more obscure. We at first thought that the recipe was
    instructing us to pour a cream/egg white/sugar mixture through the
    almond paste and strainer, but this seemed unlikely because egg
    whites are viscous, and the recipe didn’t tell us to dissolve the
    sugar. Thus, the interpretive problems of a recipe go beyond a
    lack of knowledge of the early modern definitions of words.
    Rather, we have preconceived notions of what a recipe *ought* to
    look like or what cooking or, more broadly, domestic labor *ought*
    to be, and this influences our expectations even of vocabulary and
    grammar. Thus, the greater challenge for us as
    reader-practitioners of early modern recipes is cultivating a
    self-awareness of these assumptions.

-   **STUDENT O –** When selecting a recipe, I had to carefully gauge
    which recipes were available and which were out of range in both
    ingredients and accessible instructions. We started with the
    quince jelly, and even hired a professional shopper to find it for
    us, but after a day of shopping she kept sending us pictures of
    pears… and no quinces. Thus, we chose the plum candy recipe.
    Immediately, we noticed that there was almost no guidance on the
    amount of ingredients used, how the recipe should look when
    cooked, and which consistency or color should be achieved for a
    successful recipe. I realized to my dismay that the plums were
    likely too firm and altogether the wrong color for our purposes,
    the sugar was not *crude* enough of all things, and I didn’t even
    know if the consistency or quality of the water was. After we used
    the power-mixer, we decided to try the words literally according
    to the recipe, and we came out with a beautiful ruby-like liquid.
    However, no matter what, the confection would not crystallize! It
    was infuriating! We tried freezing it, we tried heating it, we
    tried heating it in a double boiler, to no avail. I think
    ultimately, we were too afraid of the sugar burning on the bottom
    of the pan. Perhaps if we used a double boiler the entire way
    through, or simply placed a smaller pan inside of the bigger pan
    that was boiling, it would have worked.

-   **STUDENT P –** I want to write about the fun I had in the process
    of making quince jelly. When we were cooking the quinces the
    entire kitchen smelled floral. The jelly was genuinely beautiful
    (clear, blood red, "resembling an oriental ruby") and had the
    subtle flavor of honey. I suspect that early modern makers and
    knowers also took pleasure from the process, which would in part
    explain why people so avidly collected, exchanged, and implemented
    them. During class I spoke about the staggering number of labor
    hours it took to make a simple jelly, but upon reflection I want
    to add that labor can be satisfying and pleasurable to the senses,
    as well. Since the quince jelly seems to be a luxury item ("proper
    to present before a king") but made from a humble ingredient, it
    could provide people of lesser means an avenue to experience
    pleasures believed to have belonged exclusively to higher classes,
    especially if they had some extra time and money on hand to
    purchase the madeira sugar. Such labor would have helped
    householders live out their fantasies about wealth in a small way,
    allowing them the opportunity to not only taste something
    delicious but also to see the like of "an oriental ruby." The
    enjoyment could be transgressive--if the jelly is "proper to
    present before a king," would consumption by any other count as a
    small act of usurpation? For the rest of the class, I want to keep
    in mind that under certain circumstances labor can be both fun and
    empowering.

-   **STUDENT Q –** I really enjoyed the reconstruction project. This
    was a vessel to uncover the significance of ingredients in this
    time and the difference in methods of creation. We learned about
    the significance of certain types of sugar, such as madeira sugar,
    which was much more pure in form, containing less molasses. The
    result of the recipe, with “oriental ruby” red color of the
    congealed jelly, was surprising. In our first iteration, when we
    used brown sugar the color was a lot more dull. Through trial, we
    were able to reach the result that we would surmise the recipe was
    hoping for. Attention to detail and tuning into our senses made
    all the difference as we tried to connect back into the period in
    which this would be common. Although this recipe possessed sort of
    vague language, we were able to make a result we were proud of.
    This recipe was typically expensive, as quinces are not local to
    France, yet the practitioner does not discuss the medicinal
    properties of quinces. The humoral elements of the stickiness and
    wetness of the quince as it aids digestion. The texture of jelly
    compliments this nicely.

-   **STUDENT R –** When we were recreating sixteenth-century almond
    custard, two things stood out majorly. Though the process seems
    more straightforward from the text, it was not an easy process at
    all. A few words carried a lot of physical effort in materializing
    them. The other important aspect was that a recipe could not be
    recreated by extrapolating only one from a cook without prior
    knowledge about other recipes in the same text and the larger
    socio-cultural context the recipe served and consumed.

    For instance, in recipe instruction my group tried to recreate, “beat”
    meant hours of smashing almonds to make it “very fine” past. One
    should spend a whole day converting almonds to a fine paste for the
    quantity the recipe instructed. I kept thinking how this process might
    have taken without the active effort of the author/practitioner, who
    was involved only to check the “fineness” of the past someone else was
    creating. Similarly, the word “garnish,” according to OED, meant “to
    fit out with anything that adorns or beautifies; to decorate,
    ornament, or embellish” and was used for architectural decorations in
    the sixteenth century. This meaning made me reflect upon the
    relationship between architectural practices and culinary customs in
    aristocratic settings.

    At two places in the recipe, the author says “beforehand,” pointing
    out recipes presented in different parts of the book. This word
    illustrates that a random recipe plucked out from a cookbook would not
    help us recreate a historic cuisine accurately without knowledge of
    other recipes and different methods of making. Harmony between dishes
    also needs to be taken care of in the recreation process to understand
    the socio-cultural context of a specific dish. For instance, humoral
    balances between ingredients and unwritten knowledge of the
    contradictory nature between types of food are not available from a
    single recipe extracted from an assemblage of culinary instructions.

-   **STUDENT S:** In class, prior to beginning work on our
    reconstruction, my group had already discussed the lack of clear
    measures in the recipes we had chosen from BnF Ms. Fr. 640, so I
    was not initially surprised to find similarly unclear measures in
    the recipe we chose. However, over the course of our series of
    attempts to make “paste of flowers and Colour of Marble,” we found
    that even very slight changes to the quantity of flowers, sugar,
    and tragacanth gum made substantial differences to the paste
    produced. This was particularly true for the gum—an increase or
    decrease of a quarter of a teaspoon made the difference between a
    material too brittle to shape, a workable paste, and a mass too
    sticky to roll smooth. To successfully follow this recipe,
    surprisingly precise knowledge of the appropriate ratios of
    ingredients is necessary. How did de Mayerne expect his readers to
    come to that knowledge? Perhaps experimentation, as we did?
    Perhaps through prior experience making paste with these
    ingredients—I was able to find other roughly contemporary recipes
    that involved making a paste with tragacanth gum, including
    another that also used flowers? Perhaps he expected readers to
    figure out the appropriate quantities by feel, adding more of one
    or another ingredient until the desired texture was achieved? Or
    maybe the degree of precision required would not have been so high
    had we produced this paste on a larger scale.

    Part of the difficulty we had in determining the appropriate ratios
    was that we were not entirely sure what the final product we were
    trying to achieve would look or feel like. Even by the conclusion of
    our reconstruction, we disagreed amongst ourselves about which of the
    pastes had been most successful. Would seventeenth-century readers of
    de Mayerne’s recipes have had a better sense of their goals in
    following this recipe? Would all of them have had more or less the
    same product in mind? Some of our uncertainty emerged from the fact
    that we were not sure what the purpose of this paste was. On what
    occasion would this recipe have been eaten and/or displayed? What
    properties of marble was de Mayerne trying to explore or imitate with
    this recipe?

-   **STUDENT T:** Little unruly acts during the act of cooking almond
    custard, such as temptations to pick an almond from the heap and
    eat (or hide to eat later), to stretch time on blanching or
    beating (for the boredom of it all), to cheat the recipe, to take
    short cuts, to be careless about cleanliness and hygiene, to not
    stand in the expected posture, to indulge in a gossip with
    co-cookers, and to get a bit lazy…immediately helped picture the
    natural yet disciplined mundaneness of kitchen labour in the
    17<sup>th</sup> century. I call them “unruly” for I am assuming
    that discipline was held paramount in aristocratic kitchens, and
    to very often indulge in them seemed to come naturally and not by
    any cultivated intention. Given the climate in the kitchen, the
    overbearing heat, the thudding and numbing sounds of utensils and
    metal clanks, the tediousness of technologies, the recurring
    short-lived pain in your hands, the easy injuries and burns, all
    of them seemed like the details that often get unrecorded in the
    historical archives. Conceptually, it speaks to the time and
    timidity in the 17<sup>th</sup> century kitchens where labour came
    controlled and organized, and fear of punishment informed the
    psychological and social behavior of the cooks.

-   **STUDENT U**: It was amazing to see how much you can learn and
    extract from a single historical recipe—offering a surprisingly
    complex insight into 16th - 17th century society in Europe. My
    group recreated a recipe from Mrs. Corlyn’s cookbook entitled, a
    syrup to soothe the stomach and to alleviate choler (stomach
    bile). Admittedly, our recipe, only a paragraph in length, had me
    skeptical about the outcome of our syrup but it came out
    perfectly—the consistency of a store bought honey! It was like
    uncovering a mystery from the past, dissecting the recipe
    word-for-word; finding meaning and relevance of the use of every
    ingredient and instruction. Moreover, I was struck by just how
    much you learn through hand techniques and through doing. While
    the vagueness of certain measurements (ex. “a handful”, “a pretty
    quantity”) proved to be intimidating at first, we came to learn
    that we must trust our intuition to make value judgments; that
    there's new knowledge to gain by being in tune with the hands that
    make.
