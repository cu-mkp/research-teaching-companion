Spike Bucklow presentation:

-   Experimental knowledge is transmitted through 1) demonstration, 2) observation, and 3) participation

-   Azurite sourcing:

    -   Spike has purchased a chunk of azurite ore about the size of 1-2golf balls

    -   Found it on the internet somewhere

    -   Not from Kremer

    -   Probably mined somewhere in Africa

    -   Can tell it is legitimate from appearance, inclusion of malachite and other impurities, as well as handling properties

-   Azurite properties

    -   No color in particles smaller than 1/1000 mm (= 1 micron = 1 x 10^-6)

    -   “Good” pigment is glittery midnight blue. The more, the better

    -   By levigation of azurite in water, we separate by particle size. We wash away smaller particles, leaving the larger most vivid in color particles


Process:

-   Crush azurite ore with mortar and pestle

-   When small-ish, transfer to glass plate + muller

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image14.jpg" width="width:1.75in;height:2.48958in" >}}

-   Add some water and do rough mulling before moving to concentric mulling

    -   Observation: as it dried out, got tacky + difficult to mull smoothly/homogeneously

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image16.jpg" width="width:1.21995in;height:2.17188in" >}}

-   Transfer small amount (about as much as could fit on one finger) to mussel shell

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image7.jpg" width="width:2.33854in;height:1.31039in" >}}{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image9.jpg" width="width:1.33541in;height:2.40104in" >}}

-   Add water and swish with finger, then swirl

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image22.jpg" width="width:2.39464in;height:1.33854in" >}}{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image19.jpg" width="width:2.39063in;height:1.34473in" >}}

-   Pour off into another shell the water at the top with smaller dispersed particles

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image26.jpg" width="width:2.63889in;height:1.48438in" >}}

-   What is left in the first mussel shell is larger particles

-   Repeat adding water and pouring off until the azurite remaining is midnight blue

-   Because we are short on time:

    -   To paint out, add a small amount of gum arabic directly to azurite in shell that is still quite wet

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image3.jpg" width="width:2.4537in;height:1.38021in" >}}

-   Can add more water as needed

-   NJR: added gum arabic, painted out once, then poured off again and painted out → better color and consistency

{{< figure src="/images/media-azurite/image25.jpg" width="width:1.39471in;height:2.47396in" >}}

Wash water that was poured off successively:

Color of the azurite and the wash water after each wash:
