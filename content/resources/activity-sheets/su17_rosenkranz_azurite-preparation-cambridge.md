Spike Bucklow presentation:
-   Experimental knowledge is transmitted through 1) demonstration, 2) observation, and 3) participation
-   Azurite sourcing:
    -   Spike has purchased a chunk of azurite ore about the size of 1-2 golf balls
    -   Found it on the internet somewhere; not from Kremer; probably mined somewhere in Africa
    -   Can tell it is legitimate from appearance, inclusion of malachite and other impurities, as well as handling properties
-   Azurite properties
    -   No color in particles smaller than 1/1000 mm (= 1 micron = 1 x 10^-6)
    -   “Good” pigment is glittery midnight blue. The more, the better
    -   By levigation of azurite in water, we separate by particle size. We wash away smaller particles, leaving the larger most vivid in color particles

Process:
-   Crush azurite ore with mortar and pestle

-   When small-ish, transfer to glass plate + muller

-   Add some water and do rough mulling before moving to concentric mulling
    -   Observation: as it dried out, got tacky + difficult to mull smoothly/homogeneously

-   Transfer small amount (about as much as could fit on one finger) to mussel shell

-   Add water and swish with finger, then swirl

-   Pour off into another shell the water at the top with smaller dispersed particles

-   What is left in the first mussel shell is larger particles

-   Repeat adding water and pouring off until the azurite remaining is midnight blue

-   Because we are short on time:
    -   To paint out, add a small amount of gum arabic directly to azurite in shell that is still quite wet

![IMAGE](/images/media-azurite/image3.jpg)

-   Can add more water as needed

-   NJR: added gum arabic, painted out once, then poured off again and painted out → better color and consistency

Wash water that was poured off successively:
