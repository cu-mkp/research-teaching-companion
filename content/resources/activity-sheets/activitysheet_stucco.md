## Making Stucco for Molding

The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed a , both as products and as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. The manuscript includes several recipes for spirit varnishes, which were a new category of varnish that emerged in the sixteenth century. It also includes several recipes for oil-based varnishes, which have a longer history and are quite dangerous to reconstruct and often result in fires. Accordingly, M&K is only sharing protocols for making spirit varnishes. Nevertheless, making spirit varnishes raises several safety concerns and may not be suitable for all pedagogical contexts.

#### Stucco in Ms. Fr. 640
There are a handful of entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that refer to stucco, both compositions for varieties of stucco for molding and instructions for constructing a mold appropriate to use with stucco. These entries can be accessed through a search for the term "[stucco]([https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search?q=varnish*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search?q=stucco))" in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/).

There is also an excellent essay in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) that explores stucco in detail:
