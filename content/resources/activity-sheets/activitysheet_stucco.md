## Making Stucco for Molding

The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed a , both as products and as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. The manuscript includes several recipes for spirit varnishes, which were a new category of varnish that emerged in the sixteenth century. It also includes several recipes for oil-based varnishes, which have a longer history and are quite dangerous to reconstruct and often result in fires. Accordingly, M&K is only sharing protocols for making spirit varnishes. Nevertheless, making spirit varnishes raises several safety concerns and may not be suitable for all pedagogical contexts.

#### Stucco in Ms. Fr. 640
There are dozens of entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that address the making and use of varnishes. In fact, "varnish" is one of the categories that M&K has used to classify the various entries in the manuscript, and entries on varnishes account for roughly 5% of the manuscript's contents. These entries can be accessed through the "varnish" category filter in the [List of Entries](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries) and by a wildcard search for "[varnish\*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search?q=varnish*)" to catch all instances of the term in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/).


There is also an excellent essay in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/) that explores stucco in detail:
