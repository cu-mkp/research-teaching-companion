# Lesson Plans for Hands-On
Making and Knowing Lesson Plans and associated teaching resources provide step-by-step guidance in planning and executing hand-on activities in the classroom, studio, laboratory, or maker space. These Lesson Plans could be integrated into classes for skill building, as one-off sessions for class community building, or to stimulate the students' historical imagination by exposure to past materials and processes. The hands-on activities offered here can also be used as stand-alone activities for public outreach.
