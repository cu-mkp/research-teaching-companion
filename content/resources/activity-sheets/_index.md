# Lesson Plans for Hands-On
Making and Knowing Lesson Plans and associated teaching resources provide step-by-step guidance in planning and executing hand-on activities in the classroom, studio, laboratory, or maker space. These Lesson Plans could be integrated into classes for skill building, as one-off sessions for class community building, or to stimulate the students' historical imagination by exposure to past materials and processes. The hands-on activities offered here can also be used as stand-alone activities for public outreach.

### Introduction to *Secrets of Craft and Nature*
A great way to get started in a class or workshop by familiarizing students with the digital critical edition of Ms. Fr. 640 and the manuscript itself by completing a scavenger hunt of its contents.

### Historical Culinary Recipe Reconstruction
Reconstructing an obscure culinary recipe is especially effective as a first hands-on activity to familiarize students with the textual and material challenges of following past recipes. It is also a wonderful community-building exercise. The students work in groups at home for a week intepreting the recipe, searching for and obtaining ingredients, trying their recipe as many times as possible, and making a powerpoint presentation about their process and questions. Culinary results can be brought into class the next week for group digestion and discussion.

### Bread Making, Molding, and Casting
An intriguing recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 for making molds from bread is the basis for this lesson plan, which begins from the Ms. Fr. 640 recipe and expands to a multi-week series of activities, including learning to make bread, experimenting with different techniques of molding, and, finally, casting wax (or the oft-used historical casting material, sulfur) into bread. The lesson is an effective way to introduce students to embodied experience and knowledge.

### Making Stucco for Molding
This stucco activity uses rye flour and/or chalk, mixed with a binder (in the case of Ms. Fr. 640, tragacanth gum). The activity can be messy, but is a great way to learn about the production of low-cost, sometimes temporary ornamentation of walls and other surfaces. It takes one session of mixing and molding, after which the stucco ornaments are dried.

### Dyeing with Natural Colorants
With some preparation, dyeing can be carried out in two hours or less.

### Making Paints from Pigments and Painting Them Out
Making paints from pigments is an eye-opening way to get to know substances that are today mostly acquired ready-made. Lake making (i.e., transforming organic materials from dyes [water-soluble] into pigments [particles that can be painted out]), takes about three sessions. With advance preparation, mineral pigments, such as azurite, take just under two hours to prepare (not counting the mussell feast you can have the night before to collect mussell shells!). Verdigris must "grow" slowly over a month or more before sufficient amounts will form which can then be painted out. Painting out the pigments after binding them with different materials (egg yolk, egg white, oils, or gums) can be quite easy and quick, depending on how many binders the students experiment with.

#### Making Paint, Preparing Supports, and Painting Test Panels
Making supports is very satisfying and can be quick (if sewing and stretching canvases) or very, very prolonged (in the case of prepared panels)

### Making Inks
Making inks is a wonderful addition to thinking about the materiality of texts. Ink making and writing out with the ink can be done in a single session of about 45-60 minutes. Ink-making activities included here are iron gall, carbon-based, and colored organic pigment-based.

### Varnishes and Their Many Uses
Varnishes underwent a significant change in the sixteenth century that resulted in a much more streamlined making process in comparison to the heavy amber and resin varnishes of an earlier period.

### Making "Counterfeit" Jasper
Making jasper can be adapted to different class lengths, depending on advance preparation of the materials.

### Materializing Spiritual Practice: Reconstructing Burn Salve 
Reconstructing the burn salve recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 gave the Project significant insights into the meaning of materials. The activity can be done easily in 45 minutes.

## Hands-on Lesson Plans from Research Essays in *Secrets of Craft and Nature*
Many essays in *Secrets of Craft and Nature* describe the reconstruction of a technique in sufficient detail to use the essay itself to formulate a lesson plan that includes hands-on activities. These essays often include lab/field notes that contain even more information for carrying out the process. Each essay discusses themes and includes bibliography that can be integrated into course objectives and class discussion. Suggested essays are listed below, however many more could be explored and adapted for classroom, studio, or lab activities.

### Molding with Cuttlefish Bone
**[Molding with Cuttlefish Bone ](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_506_ad_20)by Emily Boyd, Jef Palframan, and Pamela H. Smith**

Cuttlefish bone is an ancient material that is still used today by goldsmiths to create small cast objects. Objects can be impressed into the soft core of the cuttlefish’s float bone, after which metal or wax can be cast into the mold. Casting could be done with tin or pewter which have low melting points and liquefy easily in a pan on a stovetop or a hot plate. 

Several entries in Ms. Fr. 640 mention cuttlefish bone as a material by which to rapidly produce molds, including fols. 91r–v and 145r–v. These entries provide a wealth of information on preparing the bones for molding, impressing models into them, and, finally, casting metals into them. They also contain descriptions of techniques by which an artisan can test the temperature of molten metal before casting. These entries particularly highlight the sensory and bodily knowledge needed by an artisan. In carrying out cuttlefish bone molding and casting, students will learn through experience the value of this sensory knowledge.

### Molding Fruits and Animals in Sugar
**[Molding Fruits and Animals in Sugar](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_017_sp_15) by Celia Durkin and Pamela H. Smith**

A single recipe in Ms. Fr. 640, on fol. 126r, gives instructions for making sugar casts of fresh fruits. Such cast sugar sculpture was a common sight at lavish banquets held in sixteenth-century European courts and cities. The author-practitioner provides practical instruction and tips for making this delicacy, but also frames his instructions within a set of properties that sugar exhibits as it changes from solid to liquid and back to solid. According to the author-practitioner, in its nature, sugar is by turns fatty, brittle, and sour. This essay explains the meaning of these properties within the author-practitioner’s material imaginary, and our reconstruction clarifies how this material imaginary provided a coherent supporting framework for the practical actions described in the recipe.

See also the Oberlin College course, *Ingenious Making in the Early Modern World*, in which each student took a different approach to molding and casting in sugar. Similar to M&K's [Fieldnotes](https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/), these portfolios document the students' hands-on activities, which included Molding Fruits in Sugar, [Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 126r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126r/f/126r/tl):

### Imitation Marble
**[Imitation Marble](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_040_sp_16) by Teresa Soley**

A reconstruction of the rather confusingly titled entry “Varnish for distemper” on fol. 56r of Ms. Fr. 640 shows that this particular varnish was not intended as a finishing layer to protect the paint and give it a sheen, as was customary in the sixteenth century. Instead, it functioned as an ingredient in the process and as a means of creating a specific optical effect—that of imitation marble.

### Keeping Dry Flowers in the Same State all Year 
**[Keeping Dry Flowers in the Same State all Year](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_049_fa_16) by Caitlyn Sellar**

The recipe “Keeping dry flowers in the same state all year” (fol. 120v–121r) reflects the author-practitioner’s wider preoccupation with the preservation of flora and fauna for display. In this recipe, he provides instructions for drying flowers in sand. A reconstruction of the recipe demonstrates that extensive knowledge of the materials is important not only to the outcome but to their handling. 

### Sleight of Hand Tricks
Ms. Fr. 640 contains an entry on fol. 43v for “Varied and Transmuted Wine.” This recipe contains no wine, but transmutes red “wine” into white. This activity is very simple and easy to integrate into any classroom setting. It also raises interesting questions about deception in art making. What is this recipe doing in a compilation of practical techniques?
