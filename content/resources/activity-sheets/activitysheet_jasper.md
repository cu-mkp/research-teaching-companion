# Counterfeit Jasper

MS Fr. 640 contains just one entry about jasper, early in the
manuscript, on fol.10r. Under an entry entitled “Counterfeit jasper”,
the author-practitioner instructs:

> Take horn from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, & underneath make
> the figure of your jasper, cornalines, & other stones, which will be a
> work more appropriate than on glass, which is too shiny. And the horn
> presents a luster & fatty polish like jasper.
>
> You know how, with scrapings of the said horn, roses can be imitated.
> The ~~horn~~ colors for this jasper want to have a base with clear
> turpentine or spike lavender varnish.
>
> And colors matte in body are not so appropriate here, although they
> are very beautiful. One needs to oil the unpainted reverse with spike
> lavender oil.

The entry is also annotated above with the line, “Thin glass for this
effect is very beautiful.” and in the left margin a longer note:

> You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the filings
> of talc or of pins on the fresh cement of the said joints. One needs
> to join them with gum ammoniac soaked in vinegar. To better
> counterfeit mottled jasper, apply wool with thick hairs dyed in
> diverse colors & intermingled. After you have layered all the colors,
> scrape oblique lines on them, then layer gold & silver leaf. If you
> layer on the horn colors of turpentine, give it a base of silver or of
> tin leaf. You can also file horn & mix it with strong glue, & layer it
> onto the joints of the piece of horn, then even it with a joiner's
> plane.

## Learning Objectives

Over a number of years, the Making and Knowing Project experimented with
this recipe, learning through iteration. At times, students focused on
certain steps in the process (for example, learning how to plane horn),
and the project team also returned to and refined processes. Our
investigations of jasper are shared here as a model of how you might
engage with a process and material in many different ways over time. It
is not necessary to complete a recipe to learn much from it. You and
your students or collaborators might well learn from building upon one
another’s investigations, or participating in one part of a larger
process. We invite you to approach hands-on research and teaching in
this spirit, and provide some resources below for you to iterate with us
on counterfeit jasper, or as inspiration for you to build open-ended
investigations on these (or indeed other) materials or recipes.

## Themes

Iterative learning, imitation, decorative arts, craft, ephemeral art

## Safety Considerations

This requires working with sharp tools and ventilation. You will be
working with some hazardous materials (varnishes contain volatile
substances, cutting horn generates particle dust).

## Overview of the process

The process of making imitation jasper described in Ms Fr. 640 can be
summarised as follows:

1.  Planing and cutting thin sheets of horn

2.  Paint sheets of horn with varnishes of various colours

    1.  Optional further treatment: apply wool to the varnished side
        > and/or scrape oblique lines into the varnish

3.  Optional application of metal leaf

4.  Oil the front side of the horn sheets with spike lavender oil to
    > increase transparency

The author-practitioner also mentions a side-project of fashioning a
rose out of the horn planings

## Materials

-   Horn (we used buffalo horn)

-   Wool yarn and unspun fleece of various colors

-   Spike lavender oil varnish (see separate instructions for making)

-   Turpentine varnish (see separate instructions)

-   Spike lavender oil (for oiling back)

-   Pigments (e.g. verdigris, lakes, smalt, azurite, malachite; we do
    > not recommend earths, leads, carbon black, soots, chars)

-   Mineral spirits (for clean-up)

-   Gold and silver leaf or transfer gold/silver

    -   This may depend on how dry the varnish layers are

## Tools 

-   Mullers

-   Glass plates

-   Brushes

-   Glass droppers

-   Plane

-   Jeweller’s saw

-   Bench anvil pin clamp

-   Sharp metal tool (dentist tools)

## Instructions

### Planing and cutting horn

-   Set up the sheet of horn secured in place at a workbench.

-   Use a small plane to take the sheet of horn down to about 2 mm
    > thickness.

-   To cut the sheet into smaller pieces,

    -   Set up a peg on the countertop, tightly secured.

    -   Secure an appropriate blade in the jeweler’s saw.

    -   Scrape lines across the length of the sheet of horn to indicate
        > where cuts will be made.

    -   Put on a protective mask to protect nose and mouth from horn
        > dust when cutting with the saw.

    -   Following the lines, use the jeweler’s saw to cut the horn into
        > rectangular sheets, using an up-and-down motion.

    -   Use a file to smooth down the edges of each rectangular sheet.

### Painting horn sheets with colored varnish

Materials

-   Horn (we used buffalo horn)

-   Wool yarn and unspun fleece of various colors

-   Spike lavender oil varnish (see separate instructions for making)

-   Turpentine varnish (see separate instructions)

-   Pigments (e.g. verdigris, lakes, smalt, azurite, malachite; we do
    > not recommend earths, leads, carbon black, soots, chars)

Tools

-   Mullers

-   Glass plates

-   Brushes

-   Glass droppers

-   (dyed) wool (optional)

The instructions in Ms. Fr. 640 suggest spike lavender oil varnish and
turpentine varnish for painting. You can try either or both.

For instructions for making these varnishes according to the manuscript,
see the links above.

-   Set up your workstation with newspaper (so the varnish doesn’t get
    > on the work surface, ground pigments, glass plates for mixing
    > pigments and varnish, mullers, palette knives, brushes, and horn
    > pieces.

<!-- -->

-   On a glass plate, mix 1g ground pigment with 2-3 drops of varnish
    > (spike lavender or turpentine) using a glass dropper. Use the
    > muller and palette knife to grind the pigment mix well.

-   Using a fresh brush, paint one entire side of one rectangular piece
    > of horn.

-   If desired, repeat with other combinations of other pigment and
    > either of the varnishes. You can also experiment with layering
    > different colors on the same piece of horn.

-   OPTIONAL When one side of the horn sheet is completely painted,
    > press wool fibres into the wet paint and arrange them into a
    > pattern of veining or marbling.

<!-- -->

-   OPTIONAL Scrape oblique lines into the varnish

### OPTIONAL metal leaf application

The manuscript mentions using gold, silver or tin leaf as a reflective
backing.

-   Remove the sheet of transfer gold leaf from packet, being careful
    > not to disrupt it and raise it off of the paper backing.

-   Press one half (lengthwise) of the painted side of one sheet of horn
    > against the transfer gold leaf. Apply pressure to make sure that
    > the horn is really pressing against the gold leaf.

-   Carefully turn over the sheet of horn and the entire square of gold
    > leaf. With a finger, rub the transfer gold leaf against the horn
    > to further secure the gold onto the oil or varnish of the hold.

-   Remove the excess of gold leaf around the piece of horn, leaving
    > behind the piece applied to the varnish.

-   Using an unassigned brush, sweep away extraneous pieces of gold leaf
    > that have not adhered to the horn. These extra pieces can also be
    > swept onto any gaps in the transfer gilding on the sheet of horn.
    > A gentle sweeping motion in one direction should do it.

    -   For at least one sheet of horn, we will consider gilding the
        > entire sheet.

        -   If we try this on the sheet of horn painted with red
            > (madder) varnish, we can consider removing the yarn that
            > we adhered to it with varnish, or we can gild the entire
            > length of the half without yarn attached to it.
