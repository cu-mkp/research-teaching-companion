# Intertextuality and the Anonymous Author-Practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640

Javier R. Ardila

## Introduction

Ms. Fr. 640 is full of mystery. Over the last decade, the Making and
Knowing project has provided valuable insights into the complexities of
this volume. An interdisciplinary team has used historical
reconstruction to explore the early modern debates surrounding natural
science, philosophy, alchemy, medicine, arts, and crafts, all while
following the recipes of an unknown author-practitioner.[^1] Despite the
project’s substantial evidence indicating that this author was not just
an educated scribe but also a practitioner of the recipes he documented,
his identity remains a mystery. Additionally, the sources he relied on
to create the volume and the purpose of his laborious endeavor are still
unclear. Another enigma appears at both the beginning and the end of the
codex: a list of authors and book titles.

The author-practitioner began a manuscript book with a list of titles
and authors. A recipe of herbs and opioids to work against the plague.
By the recipe, on the left margin, he wrote what seems to be a
reference: *Othonis episcopi Frisigensis ab orbe condito.* This loose
allusion points toward Otto Frisingensis (ca. 1114–1158), bishop of
Freising and chronicler, and to his work *Chronicon sive rerum ab orbe
condito ad sua usque tempora gestarum* \[Chronicon, or of the Events of
The World from The Creation Until Its Current Times\] (Ms640.R70D).[^2]
Right after, the author wrote a new formula, this time one “to preserve
oneself when one goes into infected air.” The recipe of vinegar, rue,
and juniper berries stands beside two references: *Abbatis Urspergensis
Chronicon* \[Konrad of Lichtenau (d. 1240), *Chronicum Abbatis
Urspergensis: a Nino Rege Assyriorum Magno usque Fridericum II*\]
(Ms640.R71D) and “Hyeronimus / Mercurialis / Variarum” \[Girolamo
Mercuriale (1530-1606), *Variarum lectionum, in medicinae scriptoribus &
aliis, libri sex* (1585)\] (Ms640.R72D). Immediately after, the writer
listed six entries of authors and titles. For an unknown reason, the
author seemed to have decided to turn the book upside down and start
working from the back of the blank book. The list of references
continues with another sixty titles at the back (now front) of the
book.[^3]

The list has provoked several possible interpretations, from the
representation of a possible physical collection of books to an ideal
list of references. Still, this document section has not yet been
analyzed in depth. Following Andrew Hui’s very provocative invitation:
“A history of Renaissance knowledge — or, for that matter, any knowledge
— without a consideration of *the study* would be incomplete. We should
study personal libraries because they are the sites of our knowledge
production — and sometimes destruction. To study the study, then, is to
take a critical gaze at our own day-to-day practice of scholarly work. A
historical investigation into the personal library would very much
inform our present habits of mind.”[^4]

This paper examines a list of eighty references included in the
manuscript. My central argument is that, despite various uncertainties
regarding the meaning or authorship of this list, it provides insight
into the cultural and intellectual landscapes of the sixteenth century.
Compiling authors and titles is not merely an intellectual exercise in
organizing scattered elements but also reflects processes of inclusion
and exclusion within a semantic field.[^5] The list is a piece of
evidence about the debates surrounding the production of the manuscript
Ms. Fr. 640. If the numerous recipes of crafts collected by the
author-practitioner show a world where practical knowledge is crucial
for interpreting the external, inner, and social worlds, the list of
titles is also a window that pushes out of the manuscript and the
workshop. Following Chartier’s description of the centripetal and
centrifugal forces in a library, reading, in general, can lead to a
process of joining and union with a broader context, as well as one for
rupture and seclusion.[^6] The interplay between reception and
appropriation leads to the idea that the list of authors and titles
serves as both pieces of a puzzle and a bridge to the intellectual
environment in which Ms. Fr. 640 was created. It also connects to
simultaneous bibliographical debates.

This essay serves a descriptive purpose rather than an argumentative
one. As previously noted, the connection between the list (presumably of
books) and the rest of the manuscript remains unclear. While a potential
disconnect may remind us of the limits of interpretation and caution us
against drawing straightforward connections between ideas, books, and
practical knowledge, this should not impede our analysis of the list
itself. The primary aim of this paper is to identify the elements that
make up the list and to explore what they reveal about the circulating
titles and authors of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries.

My description is as detailed as the available evidence allows. Due to
the limited data and supplementary sources, the reconstruction of the
list has several gaps that will remain unfilled until more evidence is
obtained. Despite these challenges, this research has identified the
authors and compiled a possible list of eighty titles.[^7] With this
information, I was able to trace the biographical and bibliographical
recognition of each entry on the list. In a few cases, the research
succeeded in making strong attributions regarding specific editions.
However, a comprehensive description of the list through the lens of
material texts has not been fully realized and is still necessary.[^8]
The information regarding this aspect was very limited and mostly
derived from the perspective of only a few titles. We can only begin to
form hypotheses about the list’s epistemological aspects after gathering
the essential elements needed to understand its contents and the
profiles of the listed elements. For now, I aim to clarify the thematic
contents of the texts listed, examine the balance between Ancient and
Modern authors, and explore the geographical concentration with an eye
toward vernacularization and nationalization.

This paper builds on over a decade of work from a diverse team of
experts. I am deeply grateful to Professor Pamela Smith for sharing the
information the team has gathered about the Collection Béthune with me
and for providing insightful commentary on this intriguing list.
Additionally, I relied largely on the transcriptions and identifications
made by the team, which were published in the digital edition of the
manuscript.[^9] Despite some minor discrepancies in the attribution of
titles, I rely on the trustworthiness and accuracy of this outstanding
transcription and translation work.[^10]

I will begin with the premise that it is essential to describe the
contents of the list before making any claims about its significance
within Ms. Fr. 640. There is much invisible and unidentified information
in this list of books, however, a more comprehensive understanding of
the list is needed before establishing possible connections between it
and the rest of the document.

## Four Lists of Titles. 

In his influential work, Jack Goody analyzed the impact of writing on
cognitive practices. His goal was to examine how literacy affects
intellect, particularly the process of reducing speech to graphic form.
Drawing on evidence collected by European anthropologists from various
regions worldwide (including Ghana, Sumer, Mesopotamia, and Egypt),
Goody demonstrated that written language caused a fundamental
transformation through the decontextualization of knowledge. This
process involves separating utterances — which are ephemeral — from
their specific contexts. Goody emphasized that writing practices
significantly enhance our ability to view words as archival resources
and tools for cognitive operations and intellectual techniques. The
meaning of written words can vary, and scriptural practices often lead
to contradictions, ambiguities, and ambivalences that depend on the
context.[^11] Goody emphasizes that lists allow the reorganization of
knowledge beyond the constraints of oral traditions. Written practices
enable a distinct relationship with knowledge storage characterized by
the flexibility of free arrangement, unlike the rigid methods found in
oral societies. As a result, writing practices significantly influence
knowledge organization by allowing permanent discontinuity.[^12]

Following Goody’s analysis, the list in Ms. Fr. 640 exhibits both
discontinuity and connections among objects within a semantic field.
While there is still uncertainty regarding the exact nature of this
list, previous and current research on the manuscript’s contents
suggests that it includes several homogeneous variables. Firstly, there
is a name attributed to an author. As Chartier points out, the
authorship of a book can involve multiple entities beyond just the
writer. In the early modern period, authorship might encompass not only
the attributed author but also translators, commentators, abridgers,
patrons, booksellers, and others involved in circulating a title and
producing a book.[^13] Secondly, some items in the list include the
title of a work. In many cases, the titles are very specific, but there
are instances where the scribe takes a less rigorous approach, using
just keywords or descriptive adjectives. Additionally, there are rare
occasions when the information provided includes the printer’s name, and
only one entry specifies the city and year of publication. Considering
these elements, it can be concluded that the list in Ms. Fr. 640
primarily serves as a compilation of authors rather than a catalog of
titles and, even more distantly, a list of books.

Information about authors, titles, and books is dispersed throughout the
manuscript. However, it can be gathered into four main sections. For
this analysis, I have categorized each section into a distinct list. The
format and content of each list differ from each other, indicating that
they serve different purposes. This variation is also reflected in the
individual entry’s appearance and the list’s overall contents and forms.

List A starts on the last page and is identified as the first part of
the list of books. It is arranged opposite the order and layout of the
manuscript’s final folio.[^14] One entry from the same list continues
onto the first page (fol. 1r), following the standard format of the
entire volume. It is noticeable that the handwriting in this list is
similar, differing from the other three lists. When combining the titles
from List A found on fols. 170v and 1r, we arrive at a total of seven
entries. This list seems to be the most comprehensive in terms of
pairing information about the titles with their respective authors. All
seven entries include details about both the author and the title. Two
of them also provide information about the printer, and one includes the
city and year of printing. The similarities extend beyond format; the
contents also reflect thematic connections, with the titles mainly
associated with Natural Philosophy and Arts and Secrets. As indicated,
the elements of List A extend into fol. 1r, where List B is also
present. However, despite the overlap between the registers, the entries
from List A maintain a distinct form, format, and content, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.

List B appears on the first page of the manuscript (fol. 1r). As shown
in Fig. 2, it was written in a different handwriting than List A. It is
unclear whether the same scribe used two styles or if the lists were
intended for two individuals. Comprising 59 entries, List B is the
longest compilation of authors and titles within Ms. Fr. 640. The list
is arranged in two columns, with each entry typically containing only
the author’s name or title and occasionally some combined information
(as seen in Fig. 3). Many authors are classical writers, each associated
with only a recognizable title. In seven instances, it was not possible
to identify the title at all. Overall, making any claims about the
edition of the items is quite challenging due to the limited information
available for attribution.

The entry to the Jewish historian Eupolemus (Second century BCE)
(Ms640.R11B) provides insights regarding the nature of the inventory.
The author-practitioner included a commentary that refers to Eupolemus
as “historicus gentilis qui de rebus Davidis & Salomonis scripsit,”
indicating that he was a pagan historian who wrote the history of David
and Solomon. The team from Making and Knowing identified that this
commentary was likely sourced from *Josuae Imperatoris Historia
Illustrata* by Andreas Masius (1514–1573), who describes Eupolemus in
very similar terms in his index.[^15] This case strengthens the
possibility that List B represents an ideal recollection of references.

**Fig. 3. Ms. Fr. 640 – Fol. 1r \[Fragment\]**

**List B**

List C introduces additional complexity. It appears in the “Livres a
recouvrer” \[Books to recover\] entry on fol. 2r. The handwriting and
format are similar to those found in List B. Although there are eight
entries, only two provide information about the titles, and one of them
remains unidentified (Ms640.R66C). Furthermore, there is a repetition
with List B, as both lists include a reference to Polydor Vergil
(Ms640.R26B, Ms640.R67C). The presence of this title and the repeated
authors suggest that at least some elements of the lists were indeed
physical books that the author or practitioner accessed, either as a
borrower or an owner.

List D compiles the references found throughout the manuscript. Although
most are located on the last page (fol. 170v), this list includes three
entries from different manuscript sections. The first entry is on fol.
1r, at the beginning of the first column, which mentions a book on
funerary practices along with a saying: “Trompettes voy le livre des
funerailles” (Ms640.R61D). The second entry, found on fol. 35v,
discusses a method for preventing someone from eating a certain food.
The author-practitioner references Matthiolus (Ms640.R80D), who suggests
adding arum, a plant known to be poisonous, to the food, assuring that
“il ny a poinct de dangier Voy Mathiol” \[there is no danger in this.
See Mathiol\]. Finally, on fol. 53v, there is a reference to a
discussion about silkworms. The author cites Girolamo Vida of Cremona’s
“Bucolica de Bombyce,” a book dedicated to this topic (Ms640.R69D).

To sum up, this research suggests that the entries for books and authors
should be categorized into four distinct lists. Each list has unique
characteristics in terms of form, format, and content. These variations
may be related not only to the author-practitioner’s physical access to
the texts but also to their intended uses and purposes. Lists A and D
appear to be most aligned with the actual practices of reading and
appropriation. List A offers a more detailed description of the titles,
while List D is more connected to the narratives of the recipes and the
use of elements from other titles, which enhance particular contents in
the manuscript or link them to broader discussions. Although brief, List
C suggests that the collection includes at least one element of
physicality. The references to “books to recover” and the repetition of
items across different sections within the lists indicate possible
overlaps between ideal and material objects in the manuscript. Lastly,
List B, being the longest, presents significant challenges. The
information provided does not allow for a definitive conclusion
regarding whether the author listed authors, titles, or books.
Nonetheless, its extensive nature invites a deeper analysis of its
contents.

## Contents of the list

After characterizing and distinguishing how the author-practitioner
presented bibliographical information in the manuscript, this section
provides an overview of the general contents of these records. The lists
have no apparent classification system, as the scribe did not include
any subject headings. Nevertheless, a close analysis reveals some
similarities between neighboring entries. To explore the thematic nature
of the list, this investigation compared three circulating
classification systems during the Renaissance, though there is no
certainty that the author-practitioner was directly aware of or applied
them. However, two of these three systems appeared in authors included
in the lists found in Ms. Fr. 640, which increases the suitability and
relevance of this attribution.

*The Etymologiae* (625 CE) by Isidore of Seville (Ms640.R9B) is a
well-known title and may have been included in the author’s list,
although there is no substantial evidence to confirm this attribution.
Isidore’s work consists of twenty books, which can be organized into the
following sections:

- Trivium (Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic),

- Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Astronomy, Music, Geometry),

- Philosophy (Poets, Sybils, Sorcerers, Pagans)

- Medicine

- Jurisprudence (laws and customs, law, crimes, punishments, Time)

- Theology (God, Patriarchs; Clergy; Monks, Church and Synagogue,
  Religion and Belief, Heresies and Schisms)

- Physics (Languages ​​and Peoples, Man and Parts of His Body, Animals,
  World, Earth, States, buildings, Sands, types of soil, products of the
  earth and water, stones)

- Mechanical and Fine Arts (Agriculture, Wars, Plastic, sculpture
  Painting, colors Clothing, jewelry, equipment)

Isidore drew from the Classical Roman tradition, especially the works of
Pliny the Elder. *Etymologiae* became highly popular and greatly
influenced knowledge organization in the encyclopedic writings of the
medieval and early Modern centuries. Additionally, *Etymologiae*
witnessed continued popularity during the Renaissance, as evidenced by
the many printed editions released and its inclusion in various lists of
the author-practitioner’s.[^16]

In *Commentariorum rerum urbanorum* (1506), Raffaele Maffei (Ms640.R3B),
professor of law in Rome and with close relations with the Papal See,
also offered a system of classification. In his work about Roman
culture, he arranged the knowledge thus:

1.  Geography and history (General geography, geography of antiquity,
    explanation of the celestial zones; countries of the world;
    geographical descriptions, the peoples living in individual
    countries and their history)

2.  Anthropology (Famous people of all times, languages, ​​and genders,
    from the ancient world and the Middle Ages; Chronological list of
    emperors, popes, scholars, etc.)

3.  Philology \[Various sciences and arts\]

    1.  Zoology

    2.  Science of man \[Medicine\]

    3.  Science of animals

    4.  Botany and agriculture

    5.  Mineralogy; architecture; various skills and crafts

    6.  Social Sciences

    7.  Ethics

    8.  Law

    9.  Politics

    10. Philological Sciences

    11. Mathematical Sciences

4.  Miscellaneous (“Paralipomena”)

During the Humanistic movement, it is fascinating to observe how authors
like Maffei expanded the scope of grammar to encompass the study of all
“realities.” Despite the mixed nature of the materials grouped together,
Maffei’s organization of knowledge about natural materials reflects a
continuation of Isidore’s influence and shows his indebtedness to
Pliny’s *Historia Naturalis*.[^17]

Thirdly, Conrad Gesner (1516-1565), in his *Bibliotheca Universalis*
(1545), presented a crucial work to understand bibliography and
knowledge classification in the early modern period.[^18] Although this
is an author not listed within Ms. Fr. 640, Gesner’s effort to bring
together authors in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew will become the model of
future catalogs of ideal and universal libraries.[^19] He will classify
the catalog as follows:

- Trivium (Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric)

- Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Astronomy)

- Astrology and Magic

- Geography

- History

- Arts, mechanical and others, (architecture, houses, craft skills,
  tools and work; on the processing of gold and silver; on the types of
  glass and mirrors; ... on sculpture, household goods, riding,
  shipping, clothing, alchemy or chemistry, painting; food, arts and
  ways of life; first of commerce, then of the trade in medicines,
  agriculture)

- Natural philosophy (Heavens and the universe, four elements, courses
  of time, of the four seasons, of the days and nights, of meteors,
  stones, metals, plants and animals, metals and similar substances
  called minerals, of plants, the soul, especially of the various
  sensations and properties, parva naturalia, \[sleep and wakefulness,
  memory and ability to remember, life and death, youth and old age,
  breathing, ages\], animals, natural magic and miracles

- First philosophy (metaphysics, philosophy and of the philosophers of
  antiquity, theology)

- Moral Philosophy

- Economic philosophy

- Civil philosophy (Politics, war)

- Civil and canon law

- Medicine

- Christian Theology

Gesner’s closer connection to university teaching and the practical
application of knowledge is noted as a compelling reason why his
classifications exhibit a more specialized focus for each discipline
compared to earlier systems.[^20]

The three systems of classifications (Isidore, Maffei, and Gesner)
follow the triad Liberal Arts (trivium and quadrivium), Mechanical Arts,
and Philosophy.[^21] Although there is a variation and strong emphasis
on the disciplinary and philosophical divisions among different branches
of knowledge, synthesizing the three methods could help us better
understand the thematic contents of the title lists in Ms. Fr. 640.
Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, I have applied the following
classification to the titles:

- Trivium (Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric)

- Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Astronomy)

- Geography

- History

- Mechanical and fine arts

- Poetry

- Natural Philosophy

- Human Philosophy

- Medicine

- N/A

- Theology

The distribution of themes reveals some notable discrepancies among the
categories. For instance, within the Trivium, only Grammar is
represented in the list, while from the Quadrivium, only Arithmetic and
Astronomy are included. Additionally, a category labeled
“Non-Applicable” (N/A) contains items with insufficient information
about the title or author that prevents reasonable attribution. A visual
summary of the thematic divisions can be found in Fig. 5.

The general trend indicates that most texts fall into the history
category, which includes 36 out of 80 records. This group encompasses
various types of writings, such as chronicles, biographies,
archaeological descriptions, and accounts of political and military
events. Notable titles in Universal history include Nicolaus of
Damascus’s *Universali Historia seu de Moribus Gentium* (Ms640.R7B),
Orosius’ *Historiae Adversus Paganos* (Ms640.R10B), Sigebert de
Gembloux’s *Chronicon* (Ms640.R62C), Giacomo Filippo Foresti’s
*Supplementum Chronicarum* (Ms640.R68C), and Otto of Freising’s
*Chronicon sive Rerum ab Orbe Condito* (Ms640.R70D).

There are also many significant authors from Greek and Roman antiquity.
Among the prominent historians from the early millennia are Appian of
Alexandria (Ms640.R27B), Suetonius (Ms640.R41B), Valerius Maximus
(Ms640.R42B), Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Ms640.R46B), Quintus Curtius
(Ms640.R57B), Cassius Dio (Ms640.R58B), and Cornelius Nepos
(Ms640.R59B). The list also features canonical historians such as
Xenophon (Ms640.R44B) and Herodotus (Ms640.R53B). Additionally, three
enigmatic contributors to the Scriptores Historiae Augoustae — Julius
Capitolinus (Ms640.R48B), Aelius Spartianus (Ms640.R50B), and Flavius
Vopiscus (Ms640.R60B) — are listed.[^22] There were also historians from
the Renaissance, such as Raffaello Maffei (Ms640.R3B), Paolo Manuzio
(Ms640.R54B), and Favio Biondo (Ms640.R51B), the latter reputed for its
distinction between the Ancient, Medieval, and Modern ages.[^23] The
lists also include authors from Late Antiquity, such as Procopius
Caesariensis his *De Rebus Gothorum, Persarum Ac Vandalorum*
(Ms640.R8B); Orosius and the criticism to the pagans (Ms640.R10B), and
the forgery of Berosus about Babylonian Antiquity (Ms640.R40B).

The history segment also includes several titles related to the
formation of early modern nationalities. Olaus Magnus’ *Historiae de
Gentibus Septentrionalibus* contributes to the narrative of the Nordic
peoples, particularly focusing on Sweden (Ms640.R21B). Works by Nagarel
(Ms640.R24B), Sabellicus (Ms640.R47B), Lichtenau (Ms640.R71D), and
Buchanan (Ms640.R71A) appropriately address Normandy, Venice, Bavaria,
and Scotland, respectively. Additionally, Paolo Emili wrote the history
of France under the commission of the King of France (Ms640.R65C), while
Philippe de Commines recorded his memories as a chronicle of his time
(Ms640.R69C).

This list of historiography titles also includes some biographies of
inventors, as, for example, the references to Polydorus Vergil his *De
Inventoribus Rerum* (Ms640.R26B). Similarly, Guillaume Budé (1467-1540)
also wrote a history of material antiquities (Ms640.R49B). Despite the
concentration on history, the author-practitioner might have enlisted or
approached them with a different purpose in mind, as the titles could be
different from a book’s primary subject matter. For example, the
reference to Conrad of Lichtenau was used to validate an argument about
a remedy to fight the plague.

The second category of quantitative importance is mechanical and fine
arts, which gathers 11 of the 80 records. This category includes not
only books on secrets, possibly included with Ruscelli (Ms640.R4B), but
also elements of practical agriculture (Ms640.R18B), calendars
(Ms640.R13B), and time in the countryside. Following the Gesner
tradition of classification, this section also should include titles on
*oeconomia* such as Froumenteau’s \[possibly Jean Frotte\] *Secrets de
finances* (LB.19) or Philibert Boyer’s *Instruction pour le faict des
fina*\[n\]*ces* (Ms640.R19B).[^24] *Questions aenigmatiques*, by Du
Verdier (Ms640.R17B), shows how the category also includes
entertainments, amusements, and the use of time. Finally, the crafts
include Palissy’s *Discours admirables* (Ms640.R22B), Guichard’s
*Funérailles et Diverses Manieres d’ensevelir* (Ms640.R61D), Tilesius
*Libellus de Coloribus* (Ms640.R76A), and de l’Orme’s *Nouvelles
Inventions* (Ms640.R75A).

The section on Natural Philosophy includes six items. Among them are
Ermolano Barbaro’s comments on Pliny (Ms640.R5B), Ippolito Salvini’s
work on aquatic animals (Ms640.R23B), and Girolamo Vida’s description of
silkworms (Ms640.R79D). Additionally, it contains Rembert Dodoens’
studies on botany (Ms640.R74A) and the works of Marbodus (Ms640.R77A)
and Albertus Magnus on mineralogy (Ms640.R78A). In the Geography
section, there are three titles: *Cathalogue des villes* by Gilles
Corrozet (Ms640.R12B), Pausanias’ *Graeciae Descriptio* (Ms640.R29B),
and Strabo’s *Situ Orbis* (Ms640.R55B). Lastly, the Medicine section
includes references to Girolamo Mercuriale (Ms640.R72D) and Matthiolus
(Ms640.R80D).

Poetry includes five closely related titles: Pietro degli Angeli’s poems
about hunting with dogs and catching birds (Ms640.R6B); Athenaeus of
Naucratis’s description of the Greek symposium (Ms640.R28B); Statius’s
*Thebaid* (Ms640.R30B); Servius’s commentary on the *Aeneid*
(Ms640.R31B); and Macrobius’s work on Scipione (Ms640.R32B).

Grammar, the sole discipline of the trivium represented in these lists,
encompasses four titles: two concerning Latin grammar by Festus
(Ms640.R35B) and Nonius Marcellus (Ms640.R36B), one in Greek by Julius
Pollux (Ms640.R38B), and one in Italian by Mesmes (Ms640.R14B). The
Italian grammar was the first to compare Italian and French,
illustrating the shift towards vernacular language in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. Similarly, the disciplines of the quadrivium also
include four titles. In Arithmetic, we find works by Petrus Apianus
(Ms640.R2B) and Savonne’s *Arithmétique* (Ms640.R15B). In Astronomy, the
titles include Hyginus’s *Poeticon Astronomicon* (Ms640.R39B) and Julius
Firmicus Maternus’ *Astronomicon* (Ms640.R56B).

Philosophy and Theology encompass four main titles. Philosophy includes
the peripatetic Aphrodisias (Ms640.R25B), Aulus Gellius (Ms640.R33B),
and Alessandro Alessandri (Ms640.R34B), all of whom collected and
summarized the works of earlier thinkers. Theology includes only
Irenaeus (Ms640.R64B).

As mentioned, five titles could not be identified due to the lack of
specific information. The unidentified titles are Isidore of Seville,
given the place, possibly was his *Etymologiae* (Ms640.R9B); Synesius
(Ms640.R20B), who wrote extensively on politics, philosophy, and
history; Cornelius Tacitus (Ms640.R43B), a renowned historian who was
also a grammarian and orator. Seneca (Ms640.R45B), although the
author-practitioner likely referred to Seneca the Younger, who wrote
about philosophy and poetry. Finally, the humanist Paolo Giovio wrote
several titles about topics ranging from natural philosophy to human
history and chronicles (Ms640.R66C).

When analyzing the chronological distribution of authors, an interesting
aspect of the lists emerges. These lists include titles ranging from
Antiquity to the early modern period, with notable examples such as
Herodotus (circa 484–circa 425 BCE) (Ms640.R53B) and Antoine Du Verdier
(1544-1600) (Ms640.R17B). However, it is evident that most authors
concentrate on the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Following Biondus’
division of history — one that the author-practitioner might have been
familiar with (Ms640.R51B) — we can categorize the records into three
periods: Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and Modernity. For the sake of this
analysis, I will also include Late Antiquity and refer to the most
recent period as Early Modernity (see Fig. 6).

In the Antiquity section, twenty-four titles span from the Fifth century
BCE to the Second century CE. While there are some early Jewish
historians included, such as Nicolaus of Damascus (Ms640.R7B), Eupolemus
(Ms640.R11B) — both often compared to Flavius Josephus[^25] — and the
Babylonian Berosus (Ms640.R40B), most entries focus on Roman and Greek
authors.[^26] Among the Greek authors featured are Herodotus, Xenophon,
and several from the first century, including Aphrodisias, Appianus,
Athenaeus, Pausanias, Julius Pollux, Dionysius, Strabo, and Cassius Dio.
On the Roman side, we find Statius, Gellius, Festus, Hyginus, Suetonius,
Valerius Maximus, Tacitus, Seneca, Quintus Curtius, and Nepos.
Interestingly, some of these authors are grouped closely together in the
list (Ms640.R26B– Ms640.R30B, Ms640.R38B–Ms640.R46B). This arrangement
suggests that the author or compiler may have found it convenient to
cluster their names, possibly due to intellectual connections or
practical considerations regarding the distribution of their works in a
physical space.

Late Antiquity contains thirteen authors born between the third and
eighth centuries. These authors include early Christians and Romans from
both the Byzantine Empire and the West. The first group comprises
Isidore of Seville, Orosius, Rufinus of Aquileia, and Irenaeus. The
second group includes Procopius, Cassianus Bassus, Synesius, and
Macrobius. Finally, the third group comprises Servius, Nonius, and the
writers of the *Historiae Augusta*.

The Medieval section assembled limited numbers, with only five items
produced between the ninth and thirteenth centuries. However, there is
an interesting diversity in the geographical origins of the authors,
primarily from Dutch, German, and Gallic traditions, all of whom were
members of the Catholic Church. This section includes three chroniclers:
Sigebert of Gembloux, Otto of Freising, and Conrad of Lichtenau, along
with two natural philosophers, Marbodus and Albertus Magnus, the latter
recognized as a Saint by the Catholic Church.

The Renaissance, marked by the emergence of *studia humanitatis* — a
crucial element in the periodization of the early modern era — contains
the majority of the items. Thirty-eight entries span the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, featuring prominent European authors recognized for
their significant contributions to the humanist movement. Among them are
Polydore Vergil, who was friends with Thomas More and Erasmus, as well
as Guillaume Budé.[^27] In addition to these well-known figures, others
held considerable influence among their contemporaries and continue to
be studied by scholars today. Noteworthy individuals include Wolfgang
Lazius, a physician and historian; Petrus Apianus, a mathematician and
cosmographer who crafted his own instruments for cosmography and
integrated them into his published works.[^28] Raffaele Maffei, a
prominent figure in Rome, appears as part of this section of the
list.[^29] Other significant figures include Pierre de Savonne, known
for his expertise in accounting; Bernard Palissy, a renowned artisan and
natural philosopher from Paris; and Flavio Biondo.

The historical division invites us to acknowledge the authors’
geographical origins, which are not confined to modern nation-states. I
categorized the items into thirteen groups: Asia Minor, Austrian,
British, Byzantine, Dutch, Gallic, Germanic, Greek, Iberian, Italian,
Middle Eastern, Nordic, and North African. Overall, most authors were
linked to Italy as a cultural center. However, a significant shift
occurred during the Early Modern period, with an increase in items
related to the Gallic region (Fig. 7).

## Considerations

The list of titles and authors in Ms. Fr. 640 should be examined in the
context of Toulouse in the late sixteenth century.[^30] The introduction
of printed materials in the mid-fifteenth century gave a new shape to
European intellectual life.[^31] The proliferation of texts was the
result of long-term transformations in the cultural and technological
realms, such as the emergence and consolidation of universities since
the twelfth century, the expansion of a scribal culture from the
monasteries to secular scenarios, the introduction, and production of
paper, the emergence of xylography and other forms of image
reproduction.[^32] Still, the print of moveable type brought novel forms
of information circulation in the European context.

If the printing press had its first development in the German countries
and Italy, the French contexts soon implemented the new technology and
began the systematic production of print culture materials.[^33] In
terms of production, Paris and Lyons were crucial spaces for printing
press production in the fifteenth century, though Venice preserved its
overall primacy within the European context.[^34] The press appeared in
Toulouse in 1477. Like most typographic practices in other places in
France, the first printers in Toulouse had German origins, used Gothic
types, and printed documents in Latin. Heinrich Turner and Johannes
Parix were the first to establish print workshops in the city, with a
significant production of legal documentation.[^35]

If the studies of the libraries of lawyers and the elite show a
generational time lag between the publication of a work and its
introduction in French humanist libraries, the existence of at least
twenty-five thousand impressions — that resulted in about twenty-five
million copies — invites us to question the circulation of materials
beyond these elite settings.[^36] If the libraries of the richest
humanists had a very encyclopedic ambition, those more modest ones might
have to stay close to the owners’ practices and social milieu.[^37]
Pamela Smith has demonstrated that European artisans started acquiring
books during the early modern period. Inventory records indicate an
increase in book ownership among artisanal groups in the latter part of
the sixteenth century. These books — usually recorded as “small books”
in their collections — could have included not only the anticipated
religious texts but also practical how-to, poetry, or history books that
served as models in their everyday craft.[^38] Thus, studying smaller
and more discrete collections, such as Ms. Fr 640, can provide new
research avenues toward unexpected intellectual influences that may have
driven experimentation and innovation in creating material objects.

This essay began with the premise of the uncertain nature of the list
and explored four possible interpretations. The first hypothesis is that
the list may represent a collection of physical books. This
interpretation is supported by details about the publisher and List C’s
title, “Books to Recover.” These elements suggest that at least part of
the list could have had a physical form. The second and strongest
hypothesis proposes that the list serves as a collection of references.
It remains unclear how much of the list refers to existing works or an
idealized representation. The list could function as a bibliographical
representation driven by at least two motivations: first, the titles the
author-practitioner intended to acquire, and second, references gathered
from one or more authors or informants. The circulation of
bibliographies during that century, particularly those by La Croix du
Maine, is worth considering in this bibliographical endeavor.[^39] The
third hypothesis suggests that the lists might be part of a more
extensive collection, possibly linked to the donation made by Hyppolite
de Béthune to the King of France. However, current research has not
uncovered any references to these books within the will.[^40] Finally,
the fourth hypothesis considers the possibility that the
author-practitioner created a list of references to provide a scholarly
foundation for a potential printed edition of a book of recipes. In this
context, it is impossible to overlook the connection to the entry “Pour
la Boutique,” where the author-practitioner also refers to Herodotus
(fol. 162r).[^41]

After a thorough reading of the references, we identified that they can
be categorized into at least four distinct lists. Each list has specific
characteristics that suggest they may have had different purposes and
potentially different forms of material presentation. Furthermore,
recognizing clusters of entries with geographic and thematic
similarities within these lists indicates a less idiosyncratic material
organization. For instance, List C contains a series of natural
philosophy authors including Tilesius (Ms640.R76A), Marbodio
(Ms640.R78A), and Albertus Magnus (Ms640.R78A), focusing on their works
on minerals, colors, and stones.

The evidence for accepting or rejecting any of the hypotheses about the
lists remains quite limited. Nevertheless, whether considering the ideal
list of titles or a collection for a small library, the titles and
authors reflect an intellectual reality of the sixteenth century. The
author-practitioner likely worked in their scriptorium surrounded by
various book references. As Hui suggests, “All libraries are real and
imaginary.” The solitude of study encompasses both aspirations and
material conditions.[^42] The list of titles and authors invites us to
explore the connections between the titles, authors, and debates the
author-practitioner engaged in his work. Despite the uncertainty
surrounding these lists, they offer a pathway to intertextual
connections between the author’s practice and the knowledge inherited
through books.

[^8]: About the material approach to book history, McKenzie proposes
    that “A ‘sociology of texts’, \[...\] contrasts with a bibliography
    confined to logical inference from printed signs as arbitrary marks
    on parchment or paper. As I indicated earlier, claims were made for
    the ‘scientific’ status of the latter precisely because it worked
    only from the physical evidence of books themselves.” Donald F.

[^24]: About *Secrets de finances,* James Wood says, “Le secret des
    finances has been attributed to two authors, Nicholas Bernaud and
    Jean Frotte. Bernaud, a Calvinist polemicist with hermetic
    tendencies, however, was living in Geneva in 1581, and his truly
    peripatetic wanderings would seem to have made almost impossible
    sufficient access to the obvious sources for such a massive
    statistical work. Jean Frotte appears to be a more reasonable
    candidate. Frotte, who began his career as *maître d'hôtel* et des
    comptes for the Constable Bourbon, became, after the disgrace of the
    latter, secretaire des finances of Marguerite d’Angouleme, queen of
    Navarre, sister of Francis I. He was named secretaire de roi in
    1541, an office which he actually exercised from 1549 (after
    Margaret’s death) until his resignation in 1560, after the death of
    Henry II. A known Calvinist, whose five sons also adhered to the
    Huguenot party, and author of *Le miroir des Français*, also
    published in 1581, Frotte had sufficient expertise, opportunity, and
    motivation such that the attribution to him of Le secret des
    finances appears reasonably certain.” James B. Wood, “The Impact of

[^36]: Henri-Jean Martin builds these conclusions upon the study of
    Roger Doucet*, Les Bibliotheques parisiennes au XVIe siecle* (Paris,
    A. & J. Picard: 1956), Alexander Schutz, *Vernacular Books in
    Parisian Private Libraries of the Sixteenth Century* (Chapel Hill,

    1955), and Françoise Lehoux*, Gaston Olivier, aumónier du roi Henri

    of those sectors of the literate society has shown there were
    considerable libraries that included the works of Erasmus, Guillaume
    Budé, Pico de la Mirandola, Moore, Boccaccio, Petrarch, or Lorenzo
    Valla, some of which also appear in the list of Ms. Fr. 640. Most of
    these studies aggregate results from several libraries’ quantitative
    analyses, but others focused on relevant figures for a more nuanced
    approach.
