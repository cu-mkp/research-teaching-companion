# DESCRIPTION

This course introduces students to the materials, techniques, contexts,
and meanings of skilled craft and artistic practices in early modern
Europe (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon a series of topics,
including craft knowledge and artisanal epistemology; the intersections
between craft and science; and questions of historical methodology in
studying the material world of the past. The course will be run as a
“Laboratory Seminar,” with discussions of primary and secondary
materials, and their relationship to a set of hands-on activities. A
primary goal of this lab seminar is to foster activities through which
students can reflect on how learning and knowledge-making takes place
through texts and through experience (including hands-on activities).
Throughout the course, you are asked to reflect upon your own process of
learning.

Another of the seminar’s goals is to give students the opportunity to
engage with the published edition of Fr. 640, [*<u>Secrets of Craft and
Nature in Renaissance
France</u>*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/), to contribute
to the creation of the Making and Knowing Project’s [*<u>Research and
Teaching Companion</u>*](https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/)
(RTC). The culmination of the semester is a Final Project of your own
devising. These exploratory and experimental projects will help to
brainstorm, design, and implement alternative paths by which to access
the material included now in *Secrets of Craft and Knowledge* and/or
provide other forms of disseminating and engaging with the themes.
Unlike print publications, open-access digital publications do not have
an institutional framework by which they are discovered and
disseminated. It is thus important to come up with alternative paths by
which the digital edition can be accessed, discovered, disseminated,
and, ultimately, made sustainable through use. Students in past classes
have produced digital/textual analysis of Ms. Fr. 640, reconstruction
insight reports, videos for the Companion, lesson plans, and many other
original and creative projects, which are now available on the
[<u>Sandbox</u>](https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/). Throughout the
semester, you will work closely with the Making and Knowing team to
develop potential areas of exploration for the Final Project. On
successful completion, your Final Projects will be published as part of
the [*<u>Research</u>* *<u>and Teaching
Companion</u>*](https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/) or the
[<u>Sandbox</u>](https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/).

**Making and Knowing on Twitter:** You can follow the Project on Twitter
[<u>@MakingKnowing</u>](https://twitter.com/MakingKnowing) and tweet any
photos from your hands-on activities (we will re-tweet).

# ASSIGNMENTS AND EVALUATION

The following components account for the total grade in the course:

> **15% Participation, Presence, and Discussion**

-   Any learning experience is about showing up, being present, and
    > attending to your interlocutors and your own process of learning
    > and integrating course materials. Students are expected to come
    > prepared for the discussion sessions and to be truly present in
    > class discussions and activities.  
    > Please email Professor Smith, Naomi, and Caroline if you will need
    > to be absent from class.

> **10% Presentation on Historical Culinary Recipe Reconstruction**

-   Working in groups, prepare and present a powerpoint on your
    > Historical Culinary Recipe Reconstruction in class on Jan. 31.
    > Your powerpoint should be uploaded to Courseworks by Jan. 30,
    > 11:59pm.

> **25% Hands-on Assignments and Reflections**

-   Most weeks include a hands-on activity. Students should plan to
    > spend about 5 hours/week outside of the class meetings on lab and
    > homework, in addition to preparing for class discussion. Each
    > student will reflect on their hands-on activities and documents
    > with words and photos of their hands-on work, their reflections on
    > that work (including in the light of the readings and discussions)
    > and anything else they wish. This will necessitate taking notes
    > and photos during all your hands-on work - you might want to keep
    > daily or weekly journal entries (with photos), but more formal
    > reflections are due as follows (please date all entries):

    -   Participation and Presence goal(s) - what drew you to this
        > course; what do you hope/expect to learn in this course; how
        > much effort do you expect it will take; what seems

        > **cochenel(le**, **cochanele**, **cochoneel**, **cochinella**,
        > **cochonillio**; 1500s **cuchinilla**, 1600s **cuchineel**,
        > **cuchinile**, **cucheneale**, **cuchanel**, **coucheneele**,
        > **couchenille**; 1500s–1600s **cutchenele**, 1600s

        > **cutchaneale**, **cutchanel(e**, **cutchoneal(e**; (1600s
        > **quitchineel**, **chochineel**, **scutchenel**, etc.).
        > **Etymology:** \< French *cochenille*, \< Spanish *cochinilla*
        > or Italian *cocciniglia*. The latter is evidently a derivative
        > of Italian *coccino*, Latin *coccinum* scarlet robe or
        > vesture, Italian *coccineo*, Latin *coccineus*
        > scarlet-coloured, \< *coccum* scarlet, ‘grain’, originally
        > ‘berry’, in Italian *cocco* ‘graine to dye scarlet with’
        > (Florio). Spanish has also *cochinilla* ‘woodlouse’,
        > diminutive of *cochina* ‘sow’, and it has been said that
        > *cochinilla* ‘cochineal’ is the same word, from the
        > resemblance of the dried cochineal insects to woodlice in the
        > same state; but this is apparently a secondary association
        > arising out of the fortuitous identity of the words.

-   Look up “kermes” and “vermillion” in the OED and see the
    > interrelated histories of these terms as well.

# Statement on COVID-19

We are all required to uphold the [<u>Columbia Community Health
Compact</u>](https://covid19.columbia.edu/health-compact). Currently,
that recommends that all students, staff, and faculty wear a suitable
facemask inside. University policies and requirements may change during
the semester.

# Statement on Academic Integrity

The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty
and students alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity.
As members of an academic community, each one of us bears the
responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse and research in a
manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity.

Scholarship, by its very nature, is an iterative process, with ideas and
insights building one upon the other. Collaborative scholarship requires
the study of other scholars' work, the free discussion of such work, and
the explicit acknowledgement of those ideas in any work that inform our
own. This exchange of ideas relies upon a mutual trust that sources,
opinions, facts, and insights will be properly noted and carefully
credited.

In practical terms, this means that, as students, you must be
responsible for the full citations of others' ideas in all of your
research papers and projects; you must be scrupulously honest when
taking your examinations; you must always submit your own work and not
that of another student, scholar, or internet agent.

Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with
the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared
intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to
meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave
Columbia.

# Disability-Related Accommodations 

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students
must first be registered with Disability Services (DS). More information
on the DS registration process is available online at
www.health.columbia.edu/ods. Faculty must be notified of registered
students’ accommodations before exam or other accommodations will be
provided. Students who have (or think they may have) a disability are
invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at
(212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at
[<u>disability@columbia.edu</u>](mailto:disability@columbia.edu).
