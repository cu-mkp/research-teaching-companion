This Lab Seminar course studies the materials, techniques, settings, and meanings of skilled craft and artistic practices in the early modern period (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon a series of issues, including craft knowledge and artisanal epistemology; the intersections between craft and science; and questions of historical methodology and evidence in the reconstruction of historical experience.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/about/</guid><description>The Companion &amp;ldquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The Edition presents the culmination of over five years of iterative, interdisciplinary, and collaborative work—of countless dedicated and enthusiastic members, individuals, and networks of the Making and Knowing Project.
The Project, and thus the Edition, have more components than a traditional scholarly edition, making recognition and crediting more complex than conventional practices in the humanities.</description></item><item><title>Making Lake Pigment From Cochineal: A Historical Reconstruction</title><link>https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/resources/activity-sheets/pigment-cochineal-lake_assignment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching640.makingandknowing.org/resources/activity-sheets/pigment-cochineal-lake_assignment/</guid><description>The Making and Knowing Project, Columbia University
