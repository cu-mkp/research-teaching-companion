51r</u></a>, the
author-practitioner provides the reader with instructions on how to copy
a print using a method of the same name that entails wetting the print
and pressing it onto a fresh piece of paper in an attempt to dampen the
ink and ultimately transfer the image. Part of the author-practitioner&rsquo;s
recommended process involves burnishing the back of the page
with a tooth or glass, which can leave indentations or marks on the
paper. In this entry there is a particularly curious sentence: “And if you want
this not to be known, if by chance, you borrowed the piece, moisten the
paper, and the polishing that the burnisher has made on the back, which
shows what has been done, will not be known.” Not only is the
author-practitioner sharing how to counterproof, he is teaching
something potentially nefarious: how to steal and not get caught. This
essay asks the question of why might a craftsman in the sixteenth
century, like the author-practitioner or his projected reader, want to
steal a print, copy it, and surreptitiously return it.</p><p>To answer that question, first we must find why someone might want to
copy a print to begin with. As Renaissance print scholar Ad Stijnman
writes, counterproofing was an “ideal way of replicating a plate in
order to extend the print run.”<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> If the plate or matrix became damaged
or was used to the point of destruction, a printer could take a finished
print and reverse engineer another iteration of the plate, so as to
continue printing. As is demonstrated by Nicole Bertozzi’s essay
“Transferring Images”
(<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_067_fa_18>https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_067_fa_18</a>),
counterproofing is particularly useful for this task because it
preserves the original image, instead of other replicating techniques
that destroy the original.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> This might allow the printer to make any
tweaks or minor changes to the new print, and ultimately new plate,
while still being able to reference the original. This technique also
saves time: one might otherwise have to copy the original image by
redrawing it from scratch. Counterproofing, even if incomplete, provides
at least a sketch to start with.</p><p>The objective of extending a print run assumes that the printer owns the
original print, that it is of his own making and he seeks to replicate
it to continue his own ends of selling it. In the sixteenth century,
however, forging or copying the works of others was a fairly common
practice, sparking debates on authorship and ownership. Historian Brenda
Hosington points out that “the identity of the author, often absent from
medieval works, was given increasing prominence in the early modern
book.”<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><p>During this time, ideas about image originality, copies, and forgeries
were similarly changing. Famed painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer
(1471–1528) was particularly bothered and subsequently vigilant about
copies of his work, for good reason. A prolific artist, Dürer’s work was
copied and forged as early as 1494.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> He famously included a notice at
the beginning of one work, addressing would-be forgers. The colophon of
<em>The Life of the Virgin</em> (1511) warns:</p><blockquote><p>Beware, you envious thieves of the work and invention of others, keep
your thoughtless hands from these works of ours. We have received a
privilege from the famous emperor of Rome, Maximilian, that no one
shall dare to print these works in spurious forms, nor sell such
prints within the boundaries of the empire&mldr;. Printed in Nuremberg,
by Albrecht Durer, painter.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The impetus for this directive occurred several years prior. An earlier
version of <em>The Life of the Virgin</em> was published in 1502, and, in 1506,
a concerned friend of Dürer’s sent him a print that appeared to belong
to the series. After examining it and determining it was a copy, Dürer
brought a lawsuit against the creator, accomplished artist Marcantonio
Raimondi (1480–1534). Art historian Noah Charney claims that this is the
“first-known case of art-specific intellectual property law brought to
trial.”<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> Perhaps surprising to a modern audience, Raimondi was not
found at fault. The Venetian court pronounced that although they were
nearly identical and the exact same size, since he had made several
small changes to the image, including adding his own signature and the
mark of the publishing house (though keeping Dürer’s easily recognizable
monogram, in the lower left corners of the figures below), it was not a
forgery.</p><figure><img src=https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/images/media-lang/image1.jpg alt=IMAGE width=500 height=300></figure><p>Albrecht Dürer, <em>Christ Taking Leave of His Mother, from The Life

fact, many sources applaud him for his painstaking detail in copying
Dürer’s prints by hand), it is easy to imagine that the technique might
be useful in a situation such as this. Simply providing a rough outline
to guide Raimondi’s reproduction would have saved him both time and
labor, which would ultimately allow him to increase his print yield and
sell more prints faster. When selling copies, production time could be
crucial in selling as many prints as possible before the copying is
discovered.</p><p>Raimondi was known for his penchant for replication. As Charney
describes, “Raimondi was among the most famous and skillful printmakers
of the sixteenth century. He was a major artist in his own right, but he
was best known for having been Raphael’s official printmaker.”<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>
Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (1483–1520), known by the mononym Raphael,
was an internationally known painter. Though the exact terms of
Raimondi’s employment are unknown, Raphael supplied him with drawings
that Raimondi would engrave and subsequently print.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> Printing at this
time was a relatively inexpensive and new technology, and had the
potential to reach much wider audiences than painting. As art historian
Catherine Wilkinson writes, “Marcantonio’s prints came to be perceived
as substitutes for Raphael’s paintings and were widely collected and
used by such artists as Rembrandt or Delacroix, whose experience of
original paintings by Raphael was limited.”<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> Wilkinson also describes
prints as similar to a modern day reference book, writing that “prints
were ‘reproductions’ (a sort of sixteenth-century equivalent of
photographs),” and that Raimondi’s prints provided artists “with a stock
of available images, ready to use in their own works.”<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup></p><p>Art historian Hannah Friedman examines another motivation for copying:
teaching. In her lecture “Modern Michelangelos? Copies, Fakes, and New
Economies of Taste in the Early Seicento,” she describes a print of a
study of legs by printer Luca Ciamberlano (1580–1641), done after a
drawing by artist Agostino Carracci (1557–1602).<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> This and similar
prints were made as educational tools and often compiled in books.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup> The
purpose of these books, often referred to as “drawing books,” was to
teach life drawing skills outside of the typical artist workshop
environment.<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> As Friedman indicates, images from certain artists, such
as Michelangelo (1475–1564), were particularly valued as means of
learning from great masters by copying them. Some such drawings could be
successfully sold as forgeries.</p><p><img src=https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/images/media-lang/image3.jpg alt=IMAGE></p><p>Luca Ciamberlano, <em>Five Legs and Three Feet,</em> 17th century. Engraving,

unexpected development in the lucrative art market. In art historian
Christina Neilson’s essay “Demonstrating Ingenuity: The Display and
Concealment of Knowledge in Renaissance Artists’ Workshops,” she
investigates attitudes regarding knowledge sharing during this time. She
writes,</p><blockquote><p>In his treatise, Biringuccio explains why he is revealing the secret
of using mercury to extract gold and silver from metal sweepings…: ‘in
order that you [the reader] should esteem and value [this
knowledge] so much more.’<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> Biringuccio’s comment may be taken to
stand for a general attitude toward the motivation of artisans in
revealing knowledge during the Renaissance, manifested in the
explosion of manuscripts and printed books on information about the so
called mechanical arts: the value of revealing previously held secrets
lay in the appreciation of that knowledge (and the appreciation of
those who disseminated it) by patrons.<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Ms. Fr. 640 is one such text on technical knowledge; perhaps the theft
technique is included merely to entice a reader, or to assert expertise.
Neilson continues, “But to keep their patron–and other
visitors–interested, artists often withheld information to add to the
mystique of their work.”<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> This oscillation between openness and
secrecy, remaining irreplaceable to patrons while advertising to new
audiences (or new patrons), coupled with emerging questions of
authorship provides insights into why the author-practitioner may have
seen value in secretly copying imagery. Perhaps he wanted to reproduce
another’s work and sell it as his own, or innocently wanted to learn
from another artist whose prints were in demand, possibly at the request
of a patron. Inclusion of the method could have served as a means of
flaunting his skill in order to promote himself to possible students,
apprentices, other artisans, or customers. He may have wanted a copy of
an image to use as a reference, such as Raimondi’s prints after Raphael.
It could have even been a cost-saving solution to acquire new prints
without paying for them.</p><p>Though I did not have the exact materials that the author-practitioner
most likely used, I tested the basic efficacy of this technique for
removing evidence of counterproofing. I did not have a print suitable
for this test, so I used an ink drawing that I did in pen. As can be
seen in my field notes, the method worked surprisingly well.<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> I
successfully transferred the image to fresh paper, though I was not able
to print it exactly or in perfect detail. For removing evidence of the
process, I found that by following the author-practitioner’s
instructions and dampening the original, nearly all burnishing marks
were erased. Those remaining were hardly noticeable, even when closely
searching for them. Whatever the author-practitioner may have done with
his covert copies, it certainly seems he was capable of getting away
with it.</p><p><img src=https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/images/media-lang/image6.jpg alt=IMAGE></p><p>Results of counterproofing test. On the left, the new print, and on the
