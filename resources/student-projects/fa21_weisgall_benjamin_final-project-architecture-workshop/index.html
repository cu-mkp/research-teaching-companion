Plaster
cast”</a> by the V&amp;A
Museum</em></p><p>The following six-week unit is designed for students of art and
architecture and others who are already comfortable in the workshop
(<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r><em>la
boutique</em></a>)
but may be less familiar with the uses and pleasures of historical study
(<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v><em>quelque
histoire</em></a>).
Using the digital critical edition of Ms. Fr. 640, student-participants
will follow the author-practitioner and his interlocutors into an
intensive study of early modern molding and casting. This unit adopts
the M&amp;K Project’s dual pedagogical approach of conceptual articulation
alongside material fabrication, with the ultimate goal of developing
research skills in the history of techniques.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Student-participants
will not only learn how to work through actual historical “recipes” for
<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl>patternmaking</a>
and
<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl>moldmaking</a>,
but they will also have the opportunity to think creatively about those
techniques in the range of possibilities that they afford. In order to
achieve this middle position between historical work and artistic work,
the unit takes as its theme the variety of intermediary objects that are
inherent to any process of casting.</p><p>In a workshop, the final product (for instance, a decorative object made
of metal) is the horizon or the goal for the fabricator. However, the
assignments for this unit focus on the working objects that circulate
before the product is completed. For casting, these include the
<a href=https://www.doi.org/10.7916/hbnz-5z03>pattern</a> (i.e., the found
or sculpted object to be reproduced), the elements that are added to
that pattern (e.g.,
<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/164r/f/164r/tl>gates</a>,
risers, cores), and the mold itself (even ones that are not quite
object-like, like those made of the author-practitioner’s favorite
material, “<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_307_ie_19>impalpable
sand</a>”).
Casting recipes even refer to a category of models known as
“intermediates,” which represent milestones between the original
conception and the final product. Intermediary objects afford the
fabricator the opportunity to adjust,
<a href=https://doi.org/10.7916/8je7-1124>repair</a>, and critique the
design prior to beginning work on its final form.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> Intermediates are
positive models that are made to imitate the final product, much like
the final product is often meant to
<a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141r/f/141r/tl>imitate</a>
a natural object, but with one exception: intermediates exist prior to
the thing they are imitating. That said, the contemporary discourse on
art making, including Ms. Fr. 640, suggested that imitation could be
anticipatory and not just reactive. For instance, the argument was made
that finely made art objects, aside from looking like the real thing,
could actually reveal the “nature” of that thing.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> In the late
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, this kind of hands-on
knowledge-making, which had hitherto been largely ignored by an
Aristotelian tradition that held artistic production in low regard,
blossomed.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> The contention of this unit is that the imitation
performed by intermediary objects vis-à-vis final products entails an
analogous kind of knowledge-making. If art can capture the “essence” of
natural objects, then intermediates can be understood to convey the
“technical essence” of art objects.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> Whereas something’s essence has
to do with “what it is,” its technical essence pertains instead to “how
it is.” In the case of art objects, technical definitions are concerned
primarily with the ways in which things are made. This focus on
technique reflects the M&amp;K Project’s emphasis on “process over product.”
However, intermediates are themselves objects — durable, recognizable
and thing-like.<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> Therefore, they call into question any description of
technical essence that maintains a hard distinction between processes as
actions and products as things. In short, intermediates are objects
coming into being.</p><p>The primary difference between an intermediate and its corresponding
final product is material composition.<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup> In the sixteenth-century
workshop, intermediate models were often made of clay or wax, which
allow for extended or infinite working time but are vulnerable to decay.
This type of model was almost always destroyed or lost in the course of
producing the final cast, meaning the final form could only be produced
once. However, if more than one copy or more than one version of a model
was desired, the premiere material was plaster.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> Although it is
usually associated with the rise of archaeological science and public
museums, casting with plaster was an ancient technique for reproducing
artifacts and working iteratively.<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> During the sixteenth century,
molding with plaster became another crucial technique for reproducing
objects through a process known as indirect casting.<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup> Initially
developed as a means of making multiples in bronze, this method of
making multipart plaster molds without destroying the original object
laid the foundation for the explosion during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries of plaster copies of master works. Thus, a
secondary focus of this unit is on plaster as a paradigmatic
intermediary material. Compared to wax or clay, plaster can more easily
be made to imitate other materials. Not only could plaster be painted to
look like stone or even bronze, but unfinished plaster was often
construed as a stand-in for white marble.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup></p><p>The first half of the syllabus is a fast-paced introduction to early
modern casting through relevant entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and research
essays in the Edition as well as other secondary literature. Beginning
with the author-practitioner’s <a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl>idiosyncratic
method</a>
of casting sulfur into the pith of baked bread, student-participants
will move through a short series of historical reconstructions designed
to acquaint them with a variety of materials and methods. The ultimate
goal of the first half is to develop two complementary skills relevant
to the historiography of techniques: one, close reading of recipes and
other technical literature, and two, creative work (in the studio or
lab) that follows the objects rather than the text. The second half of
the syllabus applies these skills to an indirect casting project, in
which a complex object is molded in plaster pieces and then cast in
plaster. A final short assignment introduces technical writing as its
own kind of craft by asking students to describe how a particular object
was made. The overall aim is for student-participants to move beyond an
understanding of history as that which ought to be emulated or as that
which has determined the present. In contrast to these static attitudes
towards the past, and in concert with the iterative methods in Ms. Fr.
640 and similar how-to manuals, the approach to history fostered by this
unit will be skeptical insofar as the past is understood, like the
present, to be a field of possibility.</p><h2 id=syllabus>Syllabus</h2><p>Week 1 / Intermediary objects and historical study</p><ul><li><p>Mark Jarzombek, <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1425409>“Prolegomena to Critical Historiography,”</a> <em>Journal of Architectural Education</em> 52, no. 4 (1999): 197-206.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup></p></li><li><p>Michael Cole, <a href=https://doi.org/10.2307/3050690>“Cellini’s Blood,”</a> <em>The Art Bulletin</em> 81, no. 2 (1999): 215-235.</p></li><li><p>Lawrence Principe, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/00026980.2016.1213011>“Chymical Exotica in the Seventeenth Century, or, How to Make the Bologna Stone,”</a> <em>Ambix</em> 63 (2016): 118-144.</p></li></ul><p>Week 2 / Introduction to casting through Ms. Fr. 640</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/entries>Entries</a> from the manuscript on casting</p></li><li><p>Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, <a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_007_fa_14>“Uses of Sulfur for Casting,”</a> in <em>Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France.

As a subdiscipline, the history of techniques can be traced to the work of French historians of technology, such as Bertrand Gille, whose monumental <em>Histoire des techniques</em> (1977) placed technology squarely within the Aristotelian category of nature (<em>physis</em>), or, that which changes. The ambiguity of meaning of French word <em>la technique</em>, which can connote both machine activity and manual skill, is exploited heavily within this historiographical tradition. For an early expression, see the collection of essays by Lucien Febvre, Marc Bloch, Maurice Halbwachs and others, under the title “Techniques et machinisme,” <em>Annales d’histoire économique et sociale</em> 6 (1934): 606-630. One must include the work of paleo-anthropologist André Leroi-Gourhan in this bibliography, for instance his <em>Milieu et Techniques</em> (1945).&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Without making too rigid of a distinction, it would be useful here to distinguish between an intermediate object and an unfinished, or <em>non finito</em>, artwork. Whereas the latter simply needs more work or at least is made to look like it needs more work, an intermediary object, such as a mold, is, in an important sense, complete. On the <em>non finito</em> work in the Renaissance, see Andrea Bayer, “Renaissance Views of the Unfinished.” In <em>Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible</em>, edited by Kelly Baum, Andrea Bayer, and Sheena Wagstaff.

This latter category is sometimes referred to as <em>stucco</em> but inconsistently so. Although material distinctions are certainly an important issue for this unit, this short essay uses the English term plaster rather indiscriminately.&#160;<a href=#fnref:8 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:9><p>On early modern plaster casting as a practice that grew out of medieval traditions and was adapted by the new humanistic concerns of the Renaissance, see Eckart Marchand’s chapter on “Plaster and Plaster Casts in Renaissance Italy,” in <em>Plaster casts: making, collecting, and displaying from classical antiquity to the present</em>, edited by Rune Frederiksen and Eckard Marchand. New York: De Gruyter, 2010. Marchand notes how plaster casts of human bodies and body parts were used as intermediate objects by painters and sculptors alike as substitutes for live models. See Mari Lending, <em>Plaster Monuments</em> (Princeton, 2017) for a wide-ranging look at nineteenth-century plaster casts as mass media before photography. For an example of this, see the <a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?id_gallery=THES49798">cast courts at the V&amp;A Museum</a>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:9 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:10><p>Unlike lost wax casting, an indirect casting method preserves the original model by breaking the mold into pieces which can be removed from the pattern without destroying it. For an example of a plaster mold being made for a plaster cast, see the <a href=https://youtu.be/PHgEcPmCPUA>how-to video on plaster casting</a> from the V&amp;A Museum.&#160;<a href=#fnref:10 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:11><p>For a succinct discussion of intermediary materials, see Eckert Marchand, “Material distinctions: Plaster, Terracotta, and Wax in the Renaissance Artist’s Workshop,” in <em>The Matter of Art: Materials, Practices, Cultural Logics, c. 1250-1750</em>, ed. Christy Anderson, Anne Dunlop and Pamela Smith (Manchester University Press, 2015). Marchand calls this ability to point to other materials the “indexicality” of plaster. He also suggests that plaster, as opposed to clay or wax, was understood “as the lowliest in the hierarchy of materials” (173). Plaster with polychromy, which was usually reserved for final objects and is therefore peripheral to this essay, represents an extreme example of this indexicality, insofar as the plaster object is made to imitate a real object in toto. At another extreme, this self-negating quality of plaster can produce highly abstract models that seem to be immaterial, such as the mathematical models developed in the nineteenth century to describe complex geometry. For a collection of photographs of these models, see Gerd Fischer, <em>Mathematical Models: from the collections of Universities and Museums</em> (Wiesbaden: Springer, 2017).&#160;<a href=#fnref:11 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:12><p>This essay discusses the history of historical studies within schools of architecture and argues that a critical mode of historiography is needed alongside the productions of art, architecture, and history.
