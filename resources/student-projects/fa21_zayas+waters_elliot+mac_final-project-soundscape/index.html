Jonathan Sterne outlines the supposed supremacy of visual concerns in
many of the primary cultural academic disciplines. From the obsession
with the “gaze” to the primacy of the visual object, visual cultures
have dominated scholarship for centuries. Musicologist Kate Galloway
expands this observation to the recent developments of the digital
humanities, noting that “the digital humanities continues to be
astonishingly silent” (Galloway, 47), prioritizing visual and literary
scholarship. Over the past decade or so, Galloway notes that “Soundwork”
has slowly begun to creep into digital humanities fields not necessarily
in the form of sound or music-based scholarship, but in the presence of
actual sound <em>objects</em> that are created using recording and sound
analysis technologies. These objects are not scholarship that is meant
to be read in an academic journal, but rather experienced by listeners
interactively—such objects are meant to be heard. The primary
pedagogical point of these objects, Galloway writes, is to aid in
holistic digital storytelling. By increasing the level of sensory
experience in historical reconstructions, Soundwork can help modern
scholars engage with public audiences through multisensory narratives,
providing unique insight into the sonic experiences of historical
situations, environments, and events.</p><p>Interacting with these sonic objects enables a new medium of engaging
with historical materials: the historical soundscape. Though much of
this scholarship is being pursued by urban musicologists interested in
recreating particular <em>musical</em> environments from mostly pre-modern
urban societies, one project stands out as an outlier example of the
recreation of an extramusical event: <a href=https://vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu/.><u>NC State’s Virtual Paul’s Cross
Project.</u></a> In an effort to visualize
and sonically recreate John Donne’s 1622 Gunpowder Day sermon at the
courtyard of St Paul’s Cathedral in London, the Virtual Paul’s Cross
Project utilizes a myriad of digital architectural modeling software,
sound recreation technology, and evidence-based restoration techniques
to allow scholars to experience an accurate, multisensory digital
representation of a historical event. The introduction to Karin
Bijsterveld’s book on historical soundscapes outlines that such
recreations—that is, recreations of events/environments/situations
before 1900—operate through textual mediation: “Our knowledge of past
soundscapes, transient and intangible as they are, is therefore largely
dependent on historical texts in which people described what they heard
and what these sounds meant to them… And it is this mediated cultural
heritage of sound that presents us with a unique chance to study the
dramatization of urban sound” (Bijsterveld, 6). These projects thus use
various textual and contextual clues (i.e., historical documents, diary
entries, artistic representations, etc.) to piece together a mediated
soundscape that attempts to create an immersive, approximate historical
experience.</p><p>Inspired by North Carolina State University’s “Virtual Paul’s Cross
Project&rsquo;&rsquo; and other digital soundscape recreations of historical
environments, “The Soundscape of Process” is an audio recreation of the
sounds of an Early Modern workshop, specifically of the process of
lifecasting a rose based on the instructions of Ms. Fr. 640. Using Emily
Cockayne’s assertion of the noisiness of early modern urban
environments, as well as the proliferation and importance of sound in
the artisan’s workshop in the context of urban environments, we place
Ms. Fr. 640 into a possible context: the urban workshop. The author
practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 has over 300 entries dedicated to some form
of casting, with at least three references to casting a flower. While
there are several research essays detailing the reconstruction of these
recipes, the honing and modification of required techniques, and even
the significance of rendering something temporary as permanent, there is
little to no documentation of the importance of sound in a craftsman’s
workshop. This project aims not only to capture as accurately as
possible the sounds that would be present in the workshop throughout a
lifecasting, but to add to the written and visual documentation
surrounding both this recipe and others in a general sense. The
manuscript becomes the primary text to mediate the experience of sound
in an early modern workshop. The combination of several different
recipes found in the manuscript was required in order to gain a more
holistic understanding of the total process, starting with the creation
of the mold to the assemblage of the final metal product. Additionally,
images and videos from the Making and Knowing Project’s Flickr, as well
as a research essay on “Molding a Rose” and various field notes, were
consulted for further particular details. Below is a detailed
description of each step of the lifecasting process, the sounds produced
in each step, the materials necessary for recreation, and which folio is
referenced. Also included with each step is a written description in an
anecdotal style of an artisan (such as the author practitioner) moving
through the instructions with special attention paid to words indicative
of sound and noise.</p><p>We recommend listening to the audio samples with high-quality stereo
headphones, as this helps to transport the listener to the 3-D spatial
configuration of our early modern workshop.</p><h2 id=creating-the-mold>Creating the mold</h2><p>Upon entering the workshop to begin the life casting process, the
artisan must first gather the materials for constructing a mold. He must
acquire his scissors and thread found in various drawers. Milling about
his workshop, he first begins with kneading and manipulating clay into
the desired mold shape, slamming the clay down on his table to remove
any air bubbles first. He then takes the rose which he has already
prepared and fastens it within the mold, securing it with wax sprues and
thread, if necessary, and snipping away any excess leaves or petals. He
will have most likely prepared the sand which is to be poured into the
mold on a different day, but if not, he will first mix the different dry
sands to create a cohesive mixture, perhaps having to grind up larger
pieces of brick or plaster with a mortar and pestle. Then he mixes the
dry sand with water and pours it into the mold. Once everything is
secured, he lets it set and dry, then heats it with a large fire until
the plant has turned to ash. As it heats, the wax melts and drips out,
the organic material dries and burns, and the clay mold itself
solidifies. Once the heating is done, the artisan removes the sand and
ash from the mold, forcefully blowing to make sure no granules remain,
and he is left with a hardened mold ready for casting.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Sound</strong></th><th><strong>Materials</strong></th><th><strong>Folio Referenced</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Manipulation/shaping of clay</td><td>clay, hands</td><td>117r: “arrange your circle & shape of clay”</td></tr><tr><td>Cutting of threads to separate rose petals</td><td>scissors, thread</td><td>145v</td></tr><tr><td>Snipping, shaping, and attachment of wax sprues</td><td>scissors, wax, rose</td><td>155r/v</td></tr><tr><td>Mixing of sand</td><td>plaster, reheated brick, sal ammoniac</td><td>121v</td></tr><tr><td>Beating of sand in water</td><td>sand mixture, water, container for water</td><td>160r</td></tr><tr><td>Pouring of sand into mold</td><td>mold, rose, sand</td><td>“promptly pour your wetted sand” (117r)</td></tr><tr><td>Lighting the fire for heating, sounds of heat and crackling of fire</td><td>fire</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Heating of mold, opening/closing of kiln (NOTE: in the a-p&rsquo;s workshop this would actually have been a fire in a hearth)</td><td>kiln, mold</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dripping of melted wax</td><td>wax, mold, kiln</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Drying of the mold (crackling, etc)</td><td>mold</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blowing (out the ashes of the rose)</td><td>air, mouth</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><iframe title=vimeo-player src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/672477385?h=dd3bf8a2fe" width=640 height=360 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><h2 id=casting-the-metal>Casting the metal</h2><p>Now it is time to cast the metal into the prepared mold. The artisan
must first get out all materials necessary for this step, rummaging
through his many bins and drawers full of metal vessels, tongs, etc. He
then heats the metal over a high temperature fire until it is liquid,
and then carefully pours the metal into the mold. The metal cools and
settles, filling the workshop with sounds of crackling and sizzling.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Sound</strong></th><th><strong>Materials</strong></th><th><strong>Folio Referenced</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Melting of metal</td><td>tin/lead alloy</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Pouring of metal</td><td>mold, melted metal, various metal tools</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Various clanking sounds of metal tools</td><td>metal tools</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Dripping of excess metal</td><td>metal</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Liquid metal cooling, solidifying, and settling</td><td>metal</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><iframe title=vimeo-player src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/672823504?h=2b58f0a685" width=640 height=360 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><h2 id=recovering-the-final-product>Recovering the final product</h2><p>After the metal has cooled, it is time for the artisan to recover the
final product. Using a hammer, he must break open the clay mold
carefully, but with enough force that the mold shatters and reveals the
metal product within. This may produce a great deal of noise depending
on how difficult it is to break the mold. If the casting was done in
multiple parts, the artisan will also have to melt more metal and solder
it together. Once this is done, the final product will be complete!</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Sound</strong></th><th><strong>Materials</strong></th><th><strong>Folio Referenced</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Breaking of clay mold</td><td>mold, hammer/mallet</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Soldering (separated components of cast)</td><td>sprues, heat source, cast</td><td>155v</td></tr></tbody></table><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/672823543?h=e7d5b43da4" width=640 height=564 frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2 id=general-sounds-throughout>General sounds throughout</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Sound</strong></th><th><strong>Materials</strong></th><th><strong>Folio Referenced</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shuffling of feet/walking around</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Opening and closing of drawers</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>City Noise, people talking, animals</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>water</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Fire burning</td><td>fire</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography:</h2><p>Bijsterveld, Karin. <a href="https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/pdf/j.ctv1xxsqf.4.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A675eb21d0da6fc0ccaa4a6aaf8edbd4c"><u>“Introduction.”</u></a> In <em>Soundscapes of the Urban Past: Staged Sound as Mediated Cultural Heritage</em>. transcript Verlag, 2013.</p><p>Cockayne, Emily. “Noisy.” In <em>Hubbub: Filth, Noise, and Stench in England, 1600-1770</em>.
