Objective: Introducing and explaining concepts related to pH to students. pH testing refers to determining how acidic or basic a water-based solution is. Additionally, getting students to think about the physical property of color and what a change in color can tell an observer. Finally, making historical connections between pre-Scientific Revolution and current/modern scientific views, while also exploring the “boundaries and relationship between seventeenth-century art and science.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_atkins+joyce-farley_charlotte+siobhan_pranks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_atkins+joyce-farley_charlotte+siobhan_pranks/</guid><description>An Exploration of Humor in Ms. Fr. 640 Charlotte Atkins and Siobhan Joyce-Farley, Fall 2021

BnF Ms. Fr. 640 stands at the intersection of a pivotal moment in history, in which craftspeople who were previously illiterate began recording their procedures and trade in writing.1 Within this context, Ms. Fr. 640 is an illuminating document not only for its content on craft techniques, but for the historical milestones and trends it embodies. One of those is oral culture, and its intersection with the written one.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_jacobson_beah_final-project-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_jacobson_beah_final-project-know/</guid><description>Textual Analysis of Instances of “To Know” in Ms. Fr. 640 Beah Jacobson, Fall 2021
On folio 125r of BnF Ms. Fr. 640, the phrase “a sçavoir” appears circled and set off from a stream of surrounding marginal text on plaster; its placement suggests that it may accompany the folio’s “Scimitars” entry. Combined with an auxiliary “a,” this phrase is somewhat more enigmatic than the straightforward English infinitive “to know,” as translated in the Digital Critical Edition of the Making &amp;amp; Knowing Project.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_lin+sundar_danli+anusha_final-project_regimens-remedies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_lin+sundar_danli+anusha_final-project_regimens-remedies/</guid><description>Regimens, Recipes, and Remedies: Understanding the “Cosmetic” in Early Modern Europe Danli Lin and Anusha Sundar

In the introduction to his history of audio reproduction technologies, Jonathan Sterne outlines the supposed supremacy of visual concerns in many of the primary cultural academic disciplines. From the obsession with the “gaze” to the primacy of the visual object, visual cultures have dominated scholarship for centuries. Musicologist Kate Galloway expands this observation to the recent developments of the digital humanities, noting that “the digital humanities continues to be astonishingly silent” (Galloway, 47), prioritizing visual and literary scholarship.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_arocho_alejandra_herodotus-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_arocho_alejandra_herodotus-workshop/</guid><description>Herodotus’ ‘Workshop’: A Core (Curriculum) Pathway into Ms. Fr. 640 and its Author-Practitioner Alejandra Quintana Arocho Professor Pamela Smith | Naomi Rosenkranz | Caroline Surman Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-on History 10 May 2022

When browsing through the wide range of how-to instructions in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, it is often frustratingly unclear why the author-practitioner chose to address such disparate topics in a single text, or why he chose to arrange them in such an apparently random way. Why, for instance, does he, in the space of a single page, give advice on how to prepare earth for making molds to cast metal, record an observation about the ways in which garden lilies grow and flower, offer yet further advice on the appropriate type of earth for use in casting, and, finally, discuss the rate at which ducklings grow and how one should feed them?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_macomber_sophie_final-project-figures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_macomber_sophie_final-project-figures/</guid><description>Pictures Worth 1,000 Words: Figures and their Uses in Ms. Fr. 640 Sophie Macomber
