&lt;p>When we decided to recreate and record riddles from Ms. Fr. 640 for our
final project, our major interests were exploring accessible entry
points into the manuscript and thinking about how modes of entertainment
have and haven’t evolved across location and history. We thought that
riddles and practical jokes would be easy to recreate authentically, and
we assumed that their societal function would have stayed relatively
fixed across time. Once we actually began to research and film the
riddles, however, we realized our initial assumptions weren’t totally
correct.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_coutavas_allie_final-project-reds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_coutavas_allie_final-project-reds/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-color-red-in-ms-fr-640">The Color Red in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Bibliothèque nationale de France Ms. Fr. 640 is a late sixteenth-century
manuscript containing instructions, recipes, and practical notes on a
variety of subjects pertaining to crafts. As a text dealing with art
making and materials, the names of colors and pigments appear frequently
throughout. Using Carl Garris’ “What is &lt;em>Azur&lt;/em> in Ms. Fr. 640?” and
other published essays of the digital critical edition as models, this
paper investigates words related to ‘red’ in the manuscript, both as the
color &lt;em>rouge&lt;/em> and as red pigments and materials including lake,
vermilion, cinnabar, and rosette.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Although some color and pigment
words were used indiscriminately and interchangeably at the time, the
aim here is to track usages across the manuscript to see if certain
formulations appear in certain contexts. The first stage of this
research analyzes the entries in the manuscript to record the
author-practitioner’s language, and the second stage attempts to
identify patterns or meaning in use of words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_ghoneima_hana_final-project-oral-culture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_ghoneima_hana_final-project-oral-culture/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="oral-culture-in-ms-fr-640">Oral Culture in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 stands at the intersection of a pivotal moment in
history, in which craftspeople who were previously illiterate began
recording their procedures and trade in writing.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Within this context,
Ms. Fr. 640 is an illuminating document not only for its content on
craft techniques, but for the historical milestones and trends it
embodies. One of those is oral culture, and its intersection with the
written one. Oral culture is defined as a form of communication in which
knowledge is transmitted orally from one person to another. According to
the historian Jan Vansina, within oral culture &amp;ldquo;there must be
transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
Importantly, oral culture can be interpreted as “Any situation in which
people speak generates messages, some of which may be repeated and hence
start a process of transmission,” and it includes both the process of
oral transmission itself as well as its products.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Similarly, oral
culture can also be thought of as “a reconstruction of the past from
oral sources…which will throw light on the particular aspect of social
life under study.”&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> As such, oral culture is understood as the shared
transmission of vernacular experience, and is an important tool for the
study of historical eras in which masses were largely illiterate and
access to written work limited.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_jacobson_beah_final-project-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_jacobson_beah_final-project-know/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="textual-analysis-of-instances-of-to-know-in-ms-fr-640">Textual Analysis of Instances of “To Know” in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>On folio &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/125r/f/125r/tcn">&lt;u>125r of BnF Ms. Fr.
640&lt;/u>&lt;/a>,
the phrase “a sçavoir” appears circled and set off from a stream of
surrounding marginal text on plaster; its placement suggests that it may
accompany the folio’s “Scimitars” entry. Combined with an auxiliary “a,”
this phrase is somewhat more enigmatic than the straightforward English
infinitive “to know,” as translated in the &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/">&lt;u>Digital Critical
Edition&lt;/u>&lt;/a> of the Making &amp;amp; Knowing
Project. Rather, we might take it as a gerund or part of a verbal phrase
– something closer to the procedural sense of “for knowing” than “to
know.” Did this note in fact refer to the scimitar recipe? If so, what
made that particular recipe so worth knowing for the manuscript’s
author-practitioner? Does the phrase indicate familiarity with or the
need to learn a particular knowledge-set? And what, for the
author-practitioner, is the relationship between scimitar-making and
knowledge-making?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_lin-sundar_danli-anusha_final-project_regimens-remedies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_lin-sundar_danli-anusha_final-project_regimens-remedies/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="regimens-recipes-and-remedies-understanding-the-cosmetic-in-early-modern-europe">Regimens, Recipes, and Remedies: Understanding the “Cosmetic” in Early Modern Europe&lt;/h1>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Google search of the word “cosmetic” yields many meanings, including
anything related to beautification, correcting defects, decorating, and
clearing one’s complexion. We are also immediately reminded of beauty
models, or the scores of beauty products that line the aisles of
supermarkets. There is also the endless barrage of advertisements
featuring glistening hair, glowing skin, and miraculously spot-free
skin! Yet, there is a longer history to the world of cosmetics that is
not limited to the idea of beauty, just as scholars have pointed to how
notions of beauty are historically contingent on regions, communities,
gender, and social strata. This essay discusses how ideas about
cosmetics were closely aligned to medicinal and therapeutic uses in
early modern Europe. This will help us understand the multiplicity of
meanings that these historical understandings and quotidian uses
produced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_steinman_charlie_final-project-ms262/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_steinman_charlie_final-project-ms262/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="transcribing-translating-and-encoding-ms-gen-262-sefer-refuos-u-segulos--book-of-remedies-and-incantations">Transcribing, Translating, and Encoding MS Gen, 262: &lt;em>Sefer Refu&amp;rsquo;os u-Segulos / Book of Remedies and Incantations&lt;/em>&lt;/h1>

262&lt;/u>&lt;/a> is a collection
of recipes and other instructional texts written by a Yiddish-speaking,
Jewish practitioner in Northern Italy around 1470. The bulk of the
manuscript is in a dialect of Old Western Yiddish, bearing witness to
the increasing presence of Jews from the German-speaking lands in Italy.
Nonetheless, it is a decidedly multilingual document. Most recipes not
written in Yiddish are written in Hebrew, although there is one
incantation in Ladino. The Yiddish and Hebrew bleed freely into one
another, and the manuscript is peppered with little bits of the local
Italian vernacular, mostly for naming/glossing plants and other objects.
There are also some magical words in Latin and Aramaic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_weisgall_benjamin_final-project-architecture-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_weisgall_benjamin_final-project-architecture-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-making-and-meaning-of-intermediates-workshop-and-syllabus-for-students-of-architecture">The Making and Meaning of Intermediates: Workshop and Syllabus for Students of Architecture&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The following six-week unit is designed for students of art and

Using the digital critical edition of Ms. Fr. 640, student-participants
will follow the author-practitioner and his interlocutors into an
intensive study of early modern molding and casting. This unit adopts
the M&amp;amp;K Project’s dual pedagogical approach of conceptual articulation
alongside material fabrication, with the ultimate goal of developing
research skills in the history of techniques.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Student-participants
will not only learn how to work through actual historical “recipes” for

and
&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl">&lt;u>moldmaking&lt;/u>&lt;/a>,
but they will also have the opportunity to think creatively about those
techniques in the range of possibilities that they afford. In order to
achieve this middle position between historical work and artistic work,
the unit takes as its theme the variety of intermediary objects that are
inherent to any process of casting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_zayas-waters_elliot-mac_final-project-soundscape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/fa21_zayas-waters_elliot-mac_final-project-soundscape/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-soundscape-of-process-an-audio-recreation-of-lifecasting-in-the-workshop">The Soundscape of Process: An Audio Recreation of Lifecasting in the Workshop&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Elliot Zayas and Mac Waters, Fall 2021&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the introduction to his history of audio reproduction technologies,
Jonathan Sterne outlines the supposed supremacy of visual concerns in
many of the primary cultural academic disciplines. From the obsession
with the “gaze” to the primacy of the visual object, visual cultures
have dominated scholarship for centuries. Musicologist Kate Galloway
expands this observation to the recent developments of the digital
humanities, noting that “the digital humanities continues to be
astonishingly silent” (Galloway, 47), prioritizing visual and literary
scholarship. Over the past decade or so, Galloway notes that “Soundwork”
has slowly begun to creep into digital humanities fields not necessarily
in the form of sound or music-based scholarship, but in the presence of
actual sound &lt;em>objects&lt;/em> that are created using recording and sound
analysis technologies. These objects are not scholarship that is meant
to be read in an academic journal, but rather experienced by listeners
interactively—such objects are meant to be heard. The primary
pedagogical point of these objects, Galloway writes, is to aid in
holistic digital storytelling. By increasing the level of sensory
experience in historical reconstructions, Soundwork can help modern
scholars engage with public audiences through multisensory narratives,
providing unique insight into the sonic experiences of historical
situations, environments, and events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_arocho_alejandra_herodotus-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_arocho_alejandra_herodotus-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="herodotus-workshop-a-core-curriculum-pathway-into-ms-fr-640-and-its-author-practitioner">Herodotus’ ‘Workshop’: A Core (Curriculum) Pathway into Ms. Fr. 640 and its Author-Practitioner&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Cuttlebone, the hard interior shell of the cuttlefish, has a long history of human use. While today it is primarily consumed as a calcium
supplement by pet birds and reptiles, cuttlebone was long ago used as a
polishing powder, casting material, and carving medium. Both Aristotle
and Pliny offer detailed examinations of cuttlefish in their more general overview of cephalopods.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Its near continuous use in the arts,
especially in casting, indicates that cuttlebone has historically been
an abundant material. Paradoxically, for such a widely used material,
there is little reference to its procurement and trade either in
historical sources or secondary literature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_gardner_schuyler_final-project-sieves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_gardner_schuyler_final-project-sieves/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sieves-in-ms-fr-640">Sieves in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Spring 2022, GU4962: Hands-on History&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early modern Europe, the line between tools used in workshops and in
kitchens was blurred. Tools that crossed these spaces can reveal how
people, particularly women, could negotiate their identities within
different early modern spaces. In Ms. Fr. 640, there is a distinct
interest in tools that rest at this intersection. Whether through the
illustrations of furnaces (&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v">&lt;u>fol.
6v&lt;/u>&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/16r">&lt;u>fol.16r&lt;/u>&lt;/a>,

emphasis on which specific pots are to be employed in particular
processes (such as a “leaded pot” on &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/tl">&lt;u>fol.
3r&lt;/u>&lt;/a> or “a
varnished earthenware pot” on &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/48v/tl">&lt;u>fol.
48v&lt;/u>&lt;/a>), the
author-practitioner displays both a knowledge of and interest in how
tools traditionally marked as belonging within the kitchen were used
more broadly. One tool, the sieve, seems to receive particular attention
from the author-practitioner. For example, “Horsehair sieves” (&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/search/folio/44v/tl?q=sieve">&lt;u>fol.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In an entry of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 entitled “Counterproofing” (&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/51r/f/51r/tl">&lt;u>folio
51r&lt;/u>&lt;/a>, the
author-practitioner provides the reader with instructions on how to copy
a print using a method of the same name that entails wetting the print
and pressing it onto a fresh piece of paper in an attempt to dampen the
ink and ultimately transfer the image. Part of the author-practitioner&amp;rsquo;s
recommended process involves burnishing the back of the page
with a tooth or glass, which can leave indentations or marks on the
paper. In this entry there is a particularly curious sentence: “And if you want
this not to be known, if by chance, you borrowed the piece, moisten the
paper, and the polishing that the burnisher has made on the back, which
shows what has been done, will not be known.” Not only is the
author-practitioner sharing how to counterproof, he is teaching
something potentially nefarious: how to steal and not get caught. This
essay asks the question of why might a craftsman in the sixteenth
century, like the author-practitioner or his projected reader, want to
steal a print, copy it, and surreptitiously return it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_nebolsin_victoria_final-project_animal-rationality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp22_nebolsin_victoria_final-project_animal-rationality/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="animal-rationality-in-ms-fr-640">Animal Rationality in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/">Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/a> reveals
a surprisingly symbolic treatment of some of the animals with which the
author-practitioner engages. While overall the manuscript possesses a
mostly practical, straightforward approach, several passages on animals
display language that sings with metaphor. Snakes are explicitly
compared to Satan (fol.
&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/tl">109v&lt;/a>),
rats are compared to the tyrant of Syracuse
&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/152r/f/152r/tl">152r&lt;/a>),
and pigs can understand Greek
(&lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13v/f/13v/tl">13v&lt;/a>).
The attention that the author-practitioner allots to animals only
amplifies the perplexing nature of these remarks. As Pamela Smith

&lt;p>My project takes the form of a workshop that teaches the process of dyeing to a group of 10 high school students. This endeavor promotes hands-on artisanal production that connects materials to their effects, integrating the different stages in the process into the different forms that the materials assume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This workshop explores cochineal from three different disciplines: biology, chemistry, and history. We will begin by discussing its life cycle and habitat, then pivot to focus on the particular compound for which it is known, i.e., carminic acid. The flow of this lesson follows the transformation of materials during the process of dyeing, turning cochineal from a resource to a material to a product. Every step in the “recipe” will be contextualized briefly prior to the hands-on endeavor, then more fully explored in a conversation as we wait for the materials to heat to the proper temperature. This outline lets the process and material reality come first, then provides more abstract information once students have oriented themselves in the world around them. It also provides productive instruction time during periods of stasis integrated throughout the process of dyeing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_brown_reece_final-project_dye-workshop-instructor-lab-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_brown_reece_final-project_dye-workshop-instructor-lab-guide/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="dyeing-textiles-with-cochineal">Dyeing Textiles with Cochineal&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains a number of recipes for making pigments and
paints. Among them, the author-practitioner is especially interested in
“flesh color (&lt;em>carnation&lt;/em>),” providing 18 entries that mention this
category of colors. It is evident from the diverse instructions
contained in these recipes that flesh color is not a singular skin tone
but refers to a range of colors that may represent various human
complexions. This essay is concerned with the ways in which the concept
of “flesh color” engaged with the understandings of race and ethnicity
in the author-practitioner’s early modern Toulouse, at a time when
European colonial enterprises continued to expand in the Atlantic world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_lambert-avery_final-project_medieval-spirituality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_lambert-avery_final-project_medieval-spirituality/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="medieval-spirituality-and-materiality-in-ms-fr-640">Medieval Spirituality and Materiality in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 compiled his recipe-book in a
period of great religious, political, and social turmoil. Southern
France in the late sixteenth-century was a hotbed of conflict amidst the
Wars of Religion, during which competing religious ideas challenged
older beliefs and traditions. But where in this early modern world, and
in Ms. Fr. 640, can we find traces of earlier religious ritual
practices? An exploration of medieval spirituality and materiality
offers a framework by which to understand the manuscript’s distinctive
recipe for a burn salve and provides a glimpse of the medieval past in
the early modern workshop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_narcy_gilles_final-project_languages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_narcy_gilles_final-project_languages/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="languages-and-linguistic-agency-in-ms-fr-640">Languages and Linguistic Agency in Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;h2 id="introduction-languages-as-practical-knowledge">Introduction: Languages as practical knowledge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This essay focuses on the role played by languages in Ms. Fr. 640.
Although written in French, as its call number in the Bibliothèque
nationale de France’s catalogue indicates, it contains several
occurrences of other languages. Extensive scholarship has been dedicated
to artisan authors and the rise of books of recipes in the early modern
era, focusing on the difficulties and paradoxes of putting embodied,
practical knowledge into writing.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> The perspective adopted in this
essay is to approach writing, and more specifically the use of different
languages in various contexts, as a skill and a practical process
itself. My main contention, drawn from sociolinguistics, is that
languages, rather than neutral and substitutable vehicles for
communication, carry different meanings and implications in and of
themselves. They coexist and define themselves in relation to each other
inside a social space that can be described alternatively as an
ecology&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> or as a market&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The use of each language produces
precise textual effects in the manuscript, whether they are purposely
intended by the author-practitioner or not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_nelkin-nesya_final-project_candles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_nelkin-nesya_final-project_candles/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="candles-making-and-breaking-boundaries-in-early-modern-jewish-and-christian-ritual">Candles: Making and Breaking Boundaries in Early Modern Jewish and Christian Ritual&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Candles and their materials are ubiquitous in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. The author-practitioner suggests their use in activities as far-ranging as melting and cutting glass, smoking molds, to burning off small hairs from animals to be life-cast, to catching birds.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Beeswax and tallow (made by rendering suet, the organ fat of beef, lamb, or mutton), both very versatile substances and common candle materials, appear even more frequently, for purposes including molding, healing, food preservation, and portraiture.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> The author-practitioner hints only obliquely at sacramental uses of wax,&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and makes no mention of the ritual functions of tallow or candles themselves. However, his concern for the material properties and artisanal uses of wax, tallow, and candles cannot be read outside of a broader context in which these materials and objects were associated with a complex range of theological and symbolic meanings. This paper discusses the ritual uses of wax and tallow candles among Jews and Christians in early modern Europe, focusing specifically on the ways that candles served to establish, mediate, and break down boundaries between spaces, times, and religious communities, and on the particular significance of candles in the ritual lives of women.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_oberem-lukas_final-project_varnish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_oberem-lukas_final-project_varnish/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="varnishing-a-craft-of-closure">Varnishing, a Craft of Closure&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>As a very last step, an artisan adds varnish to a work of craft. With this small addition, we may say, the work receives its last touch. This seemingly simple fact of coating an object with varnish opens up many questions about the structural importance of finalizing an artisanal and artistic work. Varnish perfects the appearance of a work and preserves it with a thin film of oil and resin. By a finger meticulously rubbed over a painting or with a brush applied to a plank, varnish coats glass and metal, wood, and canvas. Especially in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, everything can and is potentially covered in varnish. Among a wide variety of recipes in medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, we find a great number for varnish. For instance, up to twenty percent of entries in Ms. Fr. 640 deal with the production and use of varnish.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Ms. Fr. 640 is one of many examples that account for the variety and importance of varnish in the late sixteenth century. Why is varnish so important in the processes of art and craft making? What are the structural implications of varnish being a very last step of a work?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_rao-sumant_final-project_puffball/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/sp23_rao-sumant_final-project_puffball/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="puffball-mushrooms-and-early-modern-race-making-a-skin-whitening-recipe-in-bnf-ms-fr-640">Puffball Mushrooms and Early Modern Race-Making: A Skin-Whitening Recipe in BnF Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Chinese ink brushes have become inextricably intertwined with writing culture, evolving into a symbol of literacy and the mastery of Chinese characters. Some scholars assert that the Chinese ink brush is unique as the only soft-tip brush in existence in the early modern period. This claim is challenged by the presence of similarly structured soft-tip paintbrushes in European societies, characteristically having a slender brush tube with an animal hair tuft. Records of making soft-tip brushes can be found in the fifteenth-century Italian manuscript &lt;em>Il Libro dell’Arte&lt;/em> by Cennino Cennini (known as &lt;em>The Craftsman’s Handbook&lt;/em> in English) and the sixteenth-century French manuscript BnF Ms. Fr. 640.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> While the structure and materials of the two implements share similarities, the ink brushes from China and paintbrushes from Europe exhibit variations under the hands of their users, catering to diverse writing and painting needs and further reinforcing differences in Chinese and European writing and painting habits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_branscum_elizabeth_final-project-medicinal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_branscum_elizabeth_final-project-medicinal/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="medicine-in-ms-fr-640-and-household-recipe-books">Medicine in Ms. Fr. 640 and Household Recipe Books&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>As you know by now, the origin and purpose of &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/">BnF Ms. Fr. 640&lt;/a> is still uncertain. Who is the mysterious author-practitioner who compiled these recipes, and what did he intend to do with them? Part of what makes this question so intriguing is the inclusion of recipes on such a wide variety of topics – craft, sleight of hand, and even medicine. The medical recipes in the manuscript are particularly curious. Out of over 900 entries, there are only 48 that explicitly detail medical recipes, and they are scattered throughout the manuscript with little apparent rhyme or reason. In this essay, I will look more closely at the medical entries in Ms. Fr. 640, and compare them briefly to medical recipes included in a household recipe book compiled in mid-seventeenth century England.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> This comparison, which places Ms. Fr. 640 alongside a text from a similar period whose purpose and genre is well-established, may shed light on the strategies and intent of the author-practitioner in compiling the medical recipes in Fr. 640, and raise fruitful questions for further study.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_christensen_anna_final-project-natural-things/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_christensen_anna_final-project-natural-things/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="understanding-natural-things-in-the-world-and-the-workshop">Understanding Natural Things in the World and the Workshop&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The lifecasting and preservation practices that appear in &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/">BnF Ms. Fr.
640&lt;/a> are a window into the understanding of the natural world through
craft practice during the sixteenth century. Animals that appear as
casts or natural historical specimens in the manuscript include frogs
and toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, flies, spiders, beetles, crabs,
crayfish, bats, rats, cats, and birds of various kinds. The attention
paid to these commonplace animals and their representation through craft
practices can shed light on the way nature was imagined and came to be
known during this period. Through certain choices the
author-practitioner makes around the posing, juxtaposition, and display
of his dried animal specimens and life casts, we can begin to get at his
attitude towards representing the natural. More than just seeking to
imitate the natural world, the author-practitioner’s craft reflects both
artistic considerations and attempts to understand how animals interact
with one another and with the world around them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_fox_mackenzie_final-project-disorganization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su21_fox_mackenzie_final-project-disorganization/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="was-ms-fr-640-intentionally-disorganized">Was Ms. Fr. 640 Intentionally Disorganized?&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>When browsing through the wide range of how-to instructions in &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/">BnF Ms. Fr.

to address such disparate topics in a single text, or why he chose to
arrange them in such an apparently random way. Why, for instance, does
he, in the space of a single page, give advice on how to prepare earth
for making molds to cast metal, record an observation about the ways in
which garden lilies grow and flower, offer yet further advice on the
appropriate type of earth for use in casting, and, finally, discuss the

&lt;p>Have you ever tried following a new recipe that didn't have any pictures? Not even a picture of the end result? It's hard, right?! While pictures might seem to add clutter when you're just trying to figure out how much water to add to four cups of flour or exactly to what temperature the oven needs to be set, they can be meaningful tools for communicating other kinds of information, and their use in instruction manuals and notebooks dates back centuries (see also Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks for a contemporaneous example of the use of figures), as can be seen in Ms. Fr. 640, a sixteenth-century collection of practical techniques.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su22_fld_cunningham_annika_onion-skin-dyeing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/su22_fld_cunningham_annika_onion-skin-dyeing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="dyeing-with-onion-skins">Dyeing with Onion Skins&lt;/h1>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My name is Annika Cunningham, and I am a high schooler in Boston. I have
been weaving, knitting, and crocheting for over a decade, and also enjoy
exploring the scientific methods behind these crafts. I wanted to
experiment with dye-making techniques using more affordable and
accessible materials, like onion skins!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onions originated in Asia and the Middle East, but the exact period and
geographic origin are uncertain. Turkish artisans in the mid-1400s
started using onion skins to dye carpets and rugs. Additionally, many
artisans still use these methods to create authentic rugs today. Natural
Dyes were also used by early Navajo artisans, who are known for their
woven rugs and blankets. Many started using natural dyes in the 1700s
and, in Navajo weaver Mable Burnside-Myer’s Dye chart, she shows the use
of onion skins in her work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
