&lt;p>Syllabi from the Making and Knowing Project can be used to suggest possible readings, discussion prompts, model the integration of hands-on activities with seminar-style discussion of relevant concepts and texts, and connect instructors to resources for hands-on activities. These syllabi contain links to the edition&amp;rsquo;s approximately 130 &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays">essays&lt;/a> which can be used as course readings or to instruct in reconstructions (also useful for this are &lt;a href="https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org">field notes&lt;/a>). Making and Knowing Syllabi can also be mined for their &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/">Lesson Plans&lt;/a>, while the &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/student-projects/">Student Projects&lt;/a> from Hands-On History courses can be consulted by instructors and students for inspiration in planning papers and projects, and to consider the many ways to engage with Ms. Fr. 640 and the digital edition.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>M&amp;K Resources in Use</title><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/case-studies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/case-studies/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="making-and-knowing-resources-in-use">Making and Knowing Resources in Use&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has many &lt;a href="https://www.makingandknowing.org/collaborators/">collaborators&lt;/a> from K-12 to university, to non-traditional schools and public outreach institutions, who have piloted the Making and Knowing Project&amp;rsquo;s methods, course elements, and lesson plans in their research projects, courses, and student activities. The fruits of their experience, their syllabi, student projects, and making activities are valuable for those seeking to integrate Making and Knowing resources into their teaching and research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/syllabi/syllabus_sp23_gu4962-hands-on-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/syllabi/syllabus_sp23_gu4962-hands-on-history/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hist-gu4962-making-and-knowing-in-early-modern-europe-hands-on-history">HIST GU4962: Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History&lt;/h2>
