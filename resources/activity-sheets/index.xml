&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has undertaken experiments in dyeing with natural colorants as a way to engage with various entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and as a preliminary step to &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments">making lake pigments&lt;/a>. Additionally, M&amp;amp;K has led several community outreach activites on dyeing with natural colorants that can be ported directly into the classroom. These activities and their contexts are also described on the &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/case-studies">Making and Knowing Resources in Use&lt;/a> section of the Companion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_hcr-historical-recipe-collection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_hcr-historical-recipe-collection/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="guide-to-historical-recipes-and-collections">Guide to historical recipes and collections&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Cooking is an almost universal activity – it is an art, a craft, a
science – and yet most people do it without categorizing it as such.
Cooking can provide a way for instructors to introduce hands-on
experiments and close textual analysis to their students, many of whom
will be used to following instructions from recipes and may feel more
comfortable engaging in a hands-on activity in a kitchen than a studio,
lab, or classroom. It is also very suitable for at-home assignments, or
in-class activities, as most processes can be conducted in a home or
institutional kitchen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_hcr-student/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_hcr-student/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="historical-culinary-recipe-reconstruction--student-activity-sheet">Historical Culinary Recipe Reconstruction – Student Activity Sheet&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed inks several times, both as products and as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. While the manuscript is itself written in iron gall ink (the &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; black writing ink of the Renaissance), it does not include any writing ink recipes. Learning about and making writing inks can shed light on the history and materiality of texts. Because of their relatively simple ingredients and the speed and ease of their making, writing inks are an excellent hands-on activity for beginners and experts alike. The activity can be done in small groups, as a demonstration for a larger audience, or as part of a deeper personal exploration of the materials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_jasper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_jasper/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="making-jasper">Making Jasper&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains just one entry about jasper, early in the
manuscript, on fol.10r. The entry is entitled “Counterfeit jasper,” but the author-practitioner does not mean &amp;ldquo;counterfeit&amp;rdquo; in the modern sense of being fake, fraudulent, or deceitful. Rather, he uses &amp;ldquo;counterfeit&amp;rdquo; in the early modern sense of being a portrait &amp;ndash; a faithful representation of jasper. Moreoever, as the Making and Knowing Project has come to discover, his process of making jasper, with its cumulative layering of materials one atop the other, recapitulates his understanding of how the striated rock was formed in the earth. In other words, by making jasper, the author-practitioner was attempting to extend his knowledge about natural history. For him, making became a way of knowing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="making-lake-pigments">Making Lake Pigments&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has used lake pigment making as a core skill-building exercise for its students. M&amp;amp;K has often assigned lake pigment making alongside &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/">verdigris growing&lt;/a>, which were then followed up by a &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_paintingpigments/">paint making and testing&lt;/a> activity. Nevertheless, lake pigment making can be done on its own.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has used paint and test card making as a core skill-building exercise for its students. Paint making has often been a follow-up activity to &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/">lake pigment making&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/">verdigris growing&lt;/a>, but paint making can also be undertaken using commercially produced pigments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>STUDENT A&lt;/strong>– One thing that stuck out to me throughout our recipe
reconstructions was the frustration of vague instructions - what
does “a large quantity of water” mean? What does it mean to
prepare something “as beforehand”? Many of us discussed how these
unclear instructions point to a learning based on personal
interaction with more-experienced neighbors, friends, or
superiors, and on past experience, rather than merely on textual
instruction. This learning experience isn’t unique to the early
modern period. I personally was reminded of my family’s recipes
that have been photocopied and passed down by my grandmother,
which she collected from her own mother, her old church friends,
her old neighbors, and her own experience cooking for our family.
I’ve long been frustrated by her lack of specificity - in her
bread recipe, for example, a range of yeast quantities is given,
and I always have to call my mom to ask what I should do.
Community-based learning never disappeared, but there’s no place
for it in cookbooks and published works. When did culinary
instruction start to require formality and specificity? And, more
importantly, why? My first instinct is that it may relate to
industrialization and the valorization of regularity and
uniformity. But natural ingredients and processes can’t be reduced
to uniform experience, as we all know from our experiments. This
reconstruction was a reminder that embodied knowledge is as
important as, and at times more useful than, scientific knowledge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_stucco/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_stucco/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="making-stucco-for-molding">Making Stucco for Molding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed variants of a recipe for &amp;ldquo;stucco for molding,&amp;rdquo; as described in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. This recipe uses tragacanth gum and either chalk or rye flour to produce a paste that can take on quite detailed shapes in simple molds (wood, metal, silicone) and that is very hard once dry. This activity is cheap, easy, and relatively safe to undertake with a variety of learners.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_suggestions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_suggestions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Suggestions for Additional Lesson Plans&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_supportsurfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_supportsurfaces/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="preparing-panels-canvases-and-other-supports-for-painting-gilding-and-more">Preparing Panels, Canvases, and Other Supports for Painting, Gilding, and More&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This activity teaches students how to prepare common supports, namely panels and canvases, to receive paint. The preparations outlined below ensure that any media applied to the support goes on evenly without risk of bleeding into or through that support. This activity can be undertaken as a stand-alone skill-building exercise or it can be a prelude to &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_paintingpigments/">paint making and testing&lt;/a> using &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/">hand-made lake pigments&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/">hand-grown verdigris&lt;/a>, and/or &lt;a href="https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/azurite-assignment/">hand-levigated azurite&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Hands-on activities are great for teaching and learning scenario building. Plan ahead and design the activity:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Write out protocols for yourself and any other instructors for the experiment or activity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think ahead about safety and make sure plans and appropriate equipment are in place. Work with your institution&amp;rsquo;s safety office&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a plan in advance for cleanup and waste disposal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure that the students also write out an experiment protocol, and plan class time to go over these with them. Some questions to consider as a group:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Can you give us an overview of what we plan to do today?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What materials and equippment do we need/have?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the biggest safety considerations? (e.g., heat, burns, toxicity, moving around in a shared physical space)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is our cleanup plan?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="time">Time&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Hands-on teaching is so much more time-consuming than you can ever imagine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think about and plan minutely for the time you have in one class period&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be creative if possible with your institution&amp;rsquo;s course schedule — a four-hour class period is ideal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If possible, ask students or participants to review materials before the hands-on session (e.g., read over the historical recipe, look over representative art objects, read a related article, view a making video, come up with their own interpretation of the process, or look up key terms and materials)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave plenty of time for setup and cleanup — ideally, you should try to have your students help with both&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make time in class or in the lab/studio for student discussion about their experiences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make time for summary discussion and formulating takeaways, which can take place at the following class meeting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed varnish recipes several times, both as products and as ingredients in more complex making processes described in Ms. Fr. 640. The manuscript includes several recipes for spirit varnishes, which were a new category of varnish that emerged in the sixteenth century. It also includes several recipes for oil-based varnishes, which have a longer history and are quite dangerous to reconstruct and often result in fires. Accordingly, M&amp;amp;K is only sharing protocols for making spirit varnishes. Nevertheless, making spirit varnishes raises several safety concerns and may not be suitable for all pedagogical contexts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/azurite-assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/azurite-assignment/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="skillbuilding-preparing-and-painting-with-azurite">Skillbuilding: Preparing and Painting with Azurite&lt;/h1>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The sixteenth-century artisanal/technical manual, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, contains
hundreds of entries that describe making processes and techniques from
the Renaissance. These include instructions for and observations about
painting, gilding, arms and armor production, plant cultivation, and
making molds and metal casts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ms. Fr. 640 contains three mentions of bread as a material that can be
used to take an impression of another object quickly and neatly. This impression
can be used as a mold into which sulfur or wax is cast. It is an example
of the kind of intermediate process that artists must have relied on
in the sixteenth century, akin to making a 3D printed prototype in resin
before casting in gold for a modern jeweler, but for which very little
evidence survives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/burnsalve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/burnsalve/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="activity-reconstruction-of-a-16th-century-burn-salve-recipe">Activity: Reconstruction of a 16th-Century Burn Salve Recipe&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The study of historical recipes or &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; instructions can be a powerful tool to engage with the past and to learn about daily life in a different, more tangible way than traditional textual sources.

&lt;p>In the early days of what would become the Making and Knowing Project,
Founding Director Pamela Smith came to a realization: in order to
remember and then write about her experiences in lifecasting, she would
have to take meticulous notes. Amidst the cacophony of sounds, sights,
and smells in the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s workshop, her experimentations passed in
a blur. It was only through detailed notes that she could keep
everything straight. As she organized her jottings each night, she began
to see these notes as a space for wider reflection, not just
documentation of minute processes and results. This realization was
carried over into the Project’s Laboratory Seminar. As students
undertook their own multi-week historical reconstruction research, field
notes became a central tool in chronicling not just the product, but the
processes of making and knowing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/painting-assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/painting-assignment/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="making-paints-from-pigments-and-painting-them-out">Making Paints from Pigments and Painting Them Out&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources. As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed
directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. These colorants must therefore be extracted and then made insoluble in order to use them as pigments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/scavenger-hunt-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/scavenger-hunt-2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="secrets-of-craft-and-nature-reconnaissance-directed-scavenger-hunt">&lt;em>Secrets of Craft and Nature&lt;/em> Reconnaissance (Directed Scavenger Hunt)&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>My name is Annika Cunningham, and I am a high schooler in Boston. I have
been weaving, knitting, and crocheting for over a decade, and also enjoy
exploring the scientific methods behind these crafts. I wanted to
experiment with dye-making techniques using more affordable and
accessible materials, like onion skins!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onions originated in Asia and the Middle East, but the exact period and
geographic origin are uncertain. Turkish artisans in the mid-1400s
started using onion skins to dye carpets and rugs. Additionally, many
artisans still use these methods to create authentic rugs today. Natural
Dyes were also used by early Navajo artisans, who are known for their
woven rugs and blankets. Many started using natural dyes in the 1700s
and, in Navajo weaver Mable Burnside-Myer’s Dye chart, she shows the use
of onion skins in her work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/varnish-sourcing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/varnish-sourcing/</guid><description>&lt;p>varnish sourcing&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="verdigris-pigment-growing-reconstruction">VERDIGRIS PIGMENT &amp;ldquo;GROWING&amp;rdquo; RECONSTRUCTION&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Safety Note: Nitrile/latex gloves must be worn when handling verdigris. Do not touch your mouth or bare skin. Do not scrape or grind the verdigris on food preparation surfaces.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Verdigris is a blue-green pigment prepared by exposing copper to acetic acid (vinegar), forming a basic copper acetate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
