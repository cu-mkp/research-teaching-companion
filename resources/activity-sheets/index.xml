As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. To be used as a pigment, these colorants must therefore be extracted as a solulble dye and then made insoluble by precipitating (or adsorbing) the dye onto a colorless or white, insoluble, relatively inert substrate.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/activitysheet_lake-pigments/</guid><description>Lake Pigments Lake pigments and natural colorants Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources.

This activity has two parts
Part 1 (at home before class): learn about baking bread and produce loaves to use as molds for a small object
Part 2 (in class): pour wax (and/or sulfur) into your molds, unmold

These include instructions for and observations about painting, gilding, arms and armor production, plant cultivation, and making molds and metal casts.
Ms. Fr. 640 contains three mentions of bread as a material that can be used to
take an impression of another object quickly and neatly. This impression can be used as a mold into which sulfur or wax is cast.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/burnsalve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/burnsalve/</guid><description>Activity: Reconstruction of a 16th-Century Burn Salve Recipe The study of historical recipes or &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; instructions can be a powerful tool to engage with the past and to learn about daily life in a different, more tangible way than traditional textual sources. Historical reconstruction &amp;ndash; attempting to follow or replicate the recipe &amp;ndash; can bring the past to life and provide new perspectives for experts and students alike.

Introduction My name is Annika Cunningham, and I am a high schooler in Boston. I have been weaving, knitting, and crocheting for over a decade, and also enjoy exploring the scientific methods behind these crafts. I wanted to experiment with dye-making techniques using more affordable and accessible materials, like onion skins!
Onions originated in Asia and the Middle East, but the exact period and geographic origin are uncertain.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cu-mkp.github.io/research-teaching-companion/resources/activity-sheets/verdigris-assignment/</guid><description>VERDIGRIS PIGMENT &amp;ldquo;GROWING&amp;rdquo; RECONSTRUCTION HIST GU4962: Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History

Safety Note: Nitrile/latex gloves must be worn when handling verdigris. Do not touch your mouth or bare skin. Do not scrape or grind the verdigris on food preparation surfaces.
Verdigris is a blue-green pigment prepared by exposing copper to acetic acid (vinegar), forming a basic copper acetate.</description></item></channel></rss>
