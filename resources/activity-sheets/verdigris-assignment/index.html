You will likely need to plan for a few weeks of growth before you plan to use the verdigris (e.g., for painting).</p><h2 id=historical-recipe-examples>Historical Recipe Examples</h2><p>There are a number of recipes for "growing" verdigris across Medieval and Renaissance painter's manuals.

Then cover the vase and seal it, and put it into a warm place, or dung, or underground, and leave it so for six months, and then open the vase and shake out what you find in it, and on the strips of metal, into a clean vase, and put it in the sun to dry.</td></tr><tr><td>Merrifield, Mary P., <em>Original Treatises Dating from the XIIth to XVIIIth Centuries on the Arts of Painting</em>, 2 vols (London: John Murray, 1849), vol. 1, pg. 124.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=modern-recipe-resources>Modern Recipe Resources</h2><p>Familiarize yourself with growing verdigris by browsing the <a href=http://www.vastrepast.net/www.vastrepast.net/From_Dirt_to_Shirt/Entries/2010/5/31_Making_Verdigris.html>From Dirt to Shirt</a> blog which details various recipes for verdigris (note that this blogger prepares verdigris in order to eventually use it as a <em>dye</em> while we will be using it as a <em>pigment</em>).</p><p>You will notice that some recipes call for urine in the place of vinegar.

There are two important elements: 1) a jar large enough to accommodate suspending the copper above the vinegar without being submerged in it, and 2) a tight-fitting lid and a container that can withstand the corrosive vapors of the vinegar and eventually the copper acetate crystals.</td></tr><tr><td>Copper sheet, about 2"X2" (<a href=https://www.dickblick.com/items/60503-8110/>Blick 60503 -8110 - Maid-o'-Metal, St Louis Crafts Inc</a>)</td><td>Any small piece of copper metal can be used, such as copper piping from a hardware store (cut to size that will fit inside the jar, about an inch or so in diameter and an inch or two in length). Make sure that whatever you use is 100% and not an alloy or only copper-coated.</td></tr><tr><td>~5" piece of cotton twine</td><td>This is what you will use to suspend the copper above the vinegar in the jar. Any piece of twine or string that will fit across the diameter of the jar with some extra length to hang over the sides will work.</td></tr><tr><td>About 50ml vinegar</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(or urine)</td><td>Try experimenting with different types of vinegar and make a note of their acetic acid concentration (most are diluted to 5% - check the label). Apple cider vinegar with the "mother" is likely the most similar to historical vinegar.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>To harvest the verdigris:</strong><br>nitrile or latex gloves, table covering (such as a sheet of newspaper or paper bag, plastic sheeting), ceramic or glass plate (or other flat surface), palette knife (or other sturdy flat instrument such as a butter knife or metal spoon - just make sure not to use it for anything else after!)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=instructions>Instructions</h2><p>Below is a basic recipe designed to be a straightforward version of a historical example.

To render it beautiful in distemper, some grind it with vinegar, but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To render it beautiful, grind it with urine & leave to dry. Then, whenever you like, grind it with oil. And after you have collected it with the spatula, before finishing to clean the marble, grind stil de grain yellow on it. And you will have a very beautiful green.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/tl>Fol. 58r</a> says that grinding it with urine will prevent the verdigris color from "dying."</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Painter</strong></em><br>… <em>Verdigris and orpiment must first be ground with urine before thinning them with oil. Thus they are beautiful & do not die. …</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6r/tl>Fol. 6r</a> recommends verdigris and turpentine varnish to create green burnished gold.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red or green or blue</strong></em><br>… <em>For green, temper verdigris with walnut or linseed oil & grind it, next mix in turpentine varnish and not spike lavender varnish, which is not suitable for verdigris. …</em></p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/tl>Fol. 39v</a> uses verdigris, turpentine, and mastic resin for the background of reverse-painted glass.</li></ul><blockquote><p><em><strong>Tracing some history on glass</strong></em><br>…<em>then you shall fill the background with azur d'esmail or verdigris or fine laque platte</em> <del><em>platte</em></del> <em>tempered with clear turpentine, mixed with a little of tear of mastic if you want that the colors are more even & do not spread. …</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/64r/tl>Fol. 64r</a> explains that verdigris does not require two layers of application.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Double layer</strong></em><br><em>Verdigris does not die, & thus does not need to be layered twice. But lake & others, & principally flesh colors,</em> <del><em>the</em></del> <em>require two layers. Colors hardly change when they are dry.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/65v/tl>Fol. 65v</a> states that verdigris has no body and is thus good for glazing, but that it is also harmful to other colors.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Glazing</strong></em><br><em>One commonly glazes with colors that do not have body, such as lake & verdigris. However, to use other colors, one mixes in a quantity of calcined & ground cristallin, which also has no body &</em> <del><em>makes</em></del> <em>lightens the density of the others.</em><br><br><em><strong>Imprimatura</strong></em><br><em>One needs to be quite careful about this, & not make it, as some will, with gold color which is made with the washings of oil paintbrushes, because verdigris & other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end make the colors die that are</em> <del><em>meu</em></del> <em>layered on next. It is good to do it with ceruse,</em> <del><em>& a bit of</em></del> <em>yellow ocher, & a little massicot, & make it not very thick in order that it does not crack.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/tl>Fol. 66r</a> also comments on verdigris' harmful properties.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Or mat</strong></em><br>… <em>Gold color that is made of different colors cleaned from paintbrushes for oil is not so good, & with time, tarnishes the gold because of the verdigris. …</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/105r/tl>Fol. 105r</a> states that verdigris should be added to certain other pigments to help them dry in oil.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Drying colors</strong></em><br><em>Soot black & others would not dry in oil if one did not put verdigris with it.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/tl>Fol. 129r</a> offers ways to color objects cast in metal (specifically, snakes).</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Viper color</strong></em><br>… <em>Its true color is made with good verdigris ground well with some good vinegar, if it is of lead or tin. And if it is in some place darker, fumigate this first color with sulfur, as you know. …</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/tl>Fol. 158v</a> has another way to give color to metal casts (here, leaves).</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Colors for green leaves</strong></em><br>… <em>For green, the verdigris has depth & is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the verdigris a little yellow ocher & stil de grain yellow. If the green is dark, put with it charcoal of peach tree pits, which makes a</em> <del><em>v</em></del> <em>greenish black, in the same way that black of ox foot bone looks bluish.
