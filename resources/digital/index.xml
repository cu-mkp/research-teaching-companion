&lt;h2 id="data-management-plan">Data Management Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data management is a responsibility upheld by all participants of the
the Making and Knowing Project and overseen by the Project Director, Assistant Director, and Digital Lead. The methodologies, decisions, and data management strategies
described below have been developed by the Making and Knowing Project in
the creation of &lt;a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org">&lt;em>&lt;u>Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France.
A Digital Critical Edition of BnF Ms. Fr.
640&lt;/u>&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. These principles,
influenced by the culture of “&lt;a href="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">&lt;u>minimal
computing&lt;/u>&lt;/a>” at Columbia
University, guide all content creation and digital development. All
decisions and modes of work are informed by two guiding principles: to
generate and preserve all project data in sustainable and open formats
while best facilitating the multifaceted collaborative research process;
and to ensure commitment to open access and open source standards
wherever possible. Data management will comply with Columbia policies
for &lt;a href="http://research.columbia.edu/ReaDI-Program">&lt;u>Research and Data
Integrity&lt;/u>&lt;/a> as well as with
guidelines and standards for the social sciences and humanities,
including the &lt;a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/sustainability-implementation-toolkit/">&lt;em>&lt;u>Ithaka S+R Sustainability Implementation Toolkit&lt;/u>&lt;/em>&lt;/a>
and the &lt;a href="https://sites.haa.pitt.edu/sustainabilityroadmap/">&lt;em>&lt;u>Socio-Technical Sustainability
Roadmap&lt;/u>&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
