## Reading and Browsing the Manuscript

The Edition consists of four versions of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640:

1. **Facsimile**: Facsimile images of the manuscript pages
2. **Diplomatic**: diplomatic (verbatim) transcription of the original French text
3. **Normalized**: lightly normalized French transcription (with punctuation and diacritical marks added)
4. **Translation**: English translation

All versions can be accessed by navigating to [Read Fr. 640](/folios).


### Dual-pane Display

The manuscript is presented in a dual-pane display, allowing side-by-side viewing of any combination of two versions of the manuscript.

Quick access to the [Glossary](/folios/1r/f/1r/glossary) is a fourth option to be displayed in either pane (more about the Glossary below).


To resize the panes, drag the vertical bar dividing the view panes to adjust the width of the panes.


### Facsimile Images

The manuscript facsimile images first appear in a thumbnail grid overview which can be browsed with the scroll bar in order to navigate
to any folio. Once a page is selected, the facsimile will appear in the left pane by default.

      - Navigate by entering a page number from 1r to 170v (e.g., "8v" or "106r")


### Searching

The search returns results in the left pane from the two French transcriptions, the English translation, and the Research Essays.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-search-results.png" alt="howtouse-search-results" width="500">

Click the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> icon on the upper right of the search pane for quick tips on searching.

  - Results can be sorted by relevance or by folio (i.e., listed sequentially).

  - Results can be narrowed by where the results are found (e.g., the translation or the Research Essays).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-search-filter.png" alt="howtouse-search-filter" width="500">

  - Clicking on a result opens the manuscript page that contains the result in the opposite pane.

  - The search will return all folios which contain **all** the terms entered into the search bar (i.e., an "AND" search).

  - Enclose search terms in quotation marks to treat terms as a phrase, which will yield only results containing the exact phrase.
      - NB: phrase-level searching works only in the transcriptions and translation but not in the Research Essays.

  - Wildcard searching can be done by including an asterisk \[\*\] for a term fragment. The wildcard search allows for variations in early modern spelling, for conjugated verb forms, plurals, or singular of nouns, etc.
      - NB: the asterisk is ignored if quotation marks are used.

To return to the dual-pane view, click on "exit search" in the upper left corner.

To return to the result listing, use the back arrow in your browser, or re-enter the search in the search bar, where the search term is retained.

## Resources

See [Resources](/content/resources) for explanation of tools and companion commentary.


### [List of Entries](/entries)

The manuscript consists almost entirely of units of text under titles, which the Making and Knowing Project has called "entries."

The entries can be sorted sequentially as they appear in the manuscript or alphabetically.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries.png" alt="howtouse-listentries" width="500">

Each entry has been assigned up to three of 26 broad categories, displayed on the entry card.

Relevant terms in each entry have been encoded with semantic tags.

To see the full list of tagged terms contained in any given entry, click on the upper right drop-down menu arrow.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries-select.png" alt="howtouse-listentries-select" width="500">

To choose the version (transcription, normalized transcription, and English translation) to be displayed, use the drop-down menu within each entry.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries-version.png" alt="howtouse-listentries-version" width="500">

The List of Entries can be filtered by both entry category and semantic tag in the left pane.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries-terms.png" alt="howtouse-listentries-terms" width="500">

To filter by semantic tag, click on the desired tags to view only entries that have those tagged terms. This can be further refined by clicking on multiple tag types. For a full list of the tags and their usage, see [Principles of Encoding](/content/resources/principles#principles-of-encoding).

To filter by category, click on the desired category to view only the entries with that assigned category. This can be further refined by clicking on multiple categories. For further information about the categories, see [Entry Categories](/content/resources#entry-categories).

Links are provided to Research Essays which provide commentary on the entries.


### [Glossary](/folios/1r/f/1r/glossary)

A Glossary of distinctive terms in the manuscript can be accessed by selecting "Glossary" in the drop-down menu of the dual-pane view.

Use the alphabetical navigation bar to browse the contents.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-glossary.png" alt="howtouse-glossary" width="500">

The Glossary has a dedicated filtering search which can be used to navigate by the head-word (the manuscript's original French variant) as well as alternate and modern spellings.

**A note on early modern spelling**: if a searched word returns no hits in the Glossary, try a shorter string (e.g., the beginning of the word) or a different spelling. The manuscript's early modern French shows little standardization, and while the glossary includes common spelling variants, the list is not exhaustive. Common variations are:

  - double vs. single consonant, as in *plate* vs. *platte*

  - homonyms, e.g., aiguille, esguille; alun, alum, alung

**How to read a Glossary entry**:

Acoustrer (mod. accoutrer), v.: to prepare \[COT1611\]

- In this entry, the word as it appears in Ms. Fr. 640 is followed by its modern spelling, its part of speech, and its meaning in English. The key in square brackets indicates the source of the definition, as listed in the [Bibliography](//content/resources/bibliography). (Some Glossary entries also include language or dialect of origin.)


### [Research Essays](/essays)

Research Essays clarify the text of the manuscript, provide material, technical, and historical context, and describe student reconstructions in the Making and Knowing Laboratory.

The Essays can be accessed directly in two places: 1) within the manuscript pages and 2) in a dedicated index. They can also be found in the [List of Entries](/entries).

In the dual-pane display of the manuscript, click on the <i class="fas fa-flask"></i> essay icon to the right of the entry heading to access the essay.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-folios-essay.png" alt="howtouse-folios-essay" width="500">

In the dedicated index, the listing of essays can be viewed as small thumbnails or as cards with the essays' abstracts. Click on "expand" to read longer abstracts.

Click on the small and large grids in the left menu bar to switch between the thumbnail and card views.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-essay-grids.png" alt="howtouse-essay-grids" width="500">

On the cards in the large grid view, hover over the names for author information.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-essay-author.png" alt="howtouse-essay-author" width="500">

The Research Essays are grouped into categories:

  - **An Introduction**: written by Project and invited scholars, these essays serve as introductory resources and provide overviews of the Edition and the manuscript itself (including its codicology, probable genesis, relationship to other genres of writing, and the identity of its anonymous author-practitioner).

  - **Art and Its Making**: materials, making, and meaning of art, and the training of artists.

  - **Knowing Nature**: investigation, manipulation, and exploration of the materials and principles of nature in Fr.640.

  - **Society and Culture**: historical context of the manuscript, and society and culture in sixteenth-century France.

  - **The Making and Knowing Project**: the Making and Knowing Project, including its initiatives, pedagogy, methods, personnel, and collaborators.

To browse the essays by their categories, use the navigation bar on the left.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-essays-themes.png" alt="howtouse-essays-themes" width="500">

In any essay, click on the folio numbers contained in the text to view that manuscript page (return by clicking the back arrow in your browser).

In any essay, click on an image to view it at full size in a pop-up lightbox. Close the lightbox by clicking either on the "X" in the upper right-hand corner or outside of the image itself.

### [Bibliography](/content/resources/bibliography)

The Bibliography compiles references, texts, and authors cited in the manuscript, the editorial comments, and the glossary.

Each Research Essay contains a full bibliography of works cited in the essay.


### [Field Notes](/content/resources#field-notes-coming-soon)

Field notes recorded by students as they planned, researched, reconstructed, and wrote their laboratory essays.

The respective field notes are also linked in each student Research Essay.
