The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was
"grad-sourced" in a series of paleography and text workshops
(2014‚Äì2018) that brought together international graduate students to
become fluent in reading middle French script by transcribing and
translating Ms. Fr. 640.

For a full list of all participants in these workshops, see [Credits](/content/about/credits).

From 2016 to 2019, intensive translation and markup campaigns further
refined the text.

All work was checked and finalized by the Making and Knowing Team: Terry
Catapano, Cl√©ment Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith,
Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.

## Principles of Transcription

The transcription of Ms. Fr. 640 was carried out by graduate students
and Making and Knowing team members in Paleography and Text Workshops
held by the Making and Knowing Project from 2014 to 2018. It was then
checked and refined by the Paleography Lead Marc Smith and Senior Team members, Cl√©ment Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Pamela
Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.

Two versions of the transcriptions are included in the Digital Critical
Edition: diplomatic (verbatim) transcription in French and the lightly
normalized French transcription.

### Diplomatic Transcription

The "diplomatic" transcription attempts to render the text and marks of
the manuscript in type as faithfully in ASCII characters as necessary to
assist the reader in gaining a better sense of the original ‚Äî or better
still, of visually accessing the facsimile ‚Äî without previous knowledge
of French paleography, while also making the contents available for
treatment as a data set.

Each letter was rendered individually and by a single glyph,
disregarding any linguistically irrelevant variations in letterforms,
determined by position within the word, ligatures or cursivity, whether
conventional in sixteenth-century usage or accidental (see [Ms. Fr. 640‚Äôs
letterforms](https://www.makingandknowing.org/text-workshops/letterforms-fancybox/). This means, for example, that even long **s** (**≈ø**) (initial and medial) and short **s** (exclusively
final), which would have been distinguished in early-modern print, are
rendered in the modern form as **s**. Thus, "≈øans" is transcribed
"sans."

Additional deviations from sixteenth-century conventions are:

  - Abbreviations are marked up and expanded consistently with the general spelling system of the manuscript.
  - The transcriptions of the letters i/j and u/v, whether uppercase or lowercase, follow modern usage in distinguishing vowels and consonants.
      - While these letters were not considered distinct graphemes (vowel/consonant) in French before the late seventeenth century, the decision to distinguish between them in the transcription not only facilitates reading but also makes full-text word searches more intuitive.
      - The only formal distinction made in Ms. Fr. 640, following early modern orthography, is between v as the initial form and u elsewhere. For example, "vniuersel" is transcribed "universel."
  -  The √¶ ligature (but not the ≈ì ligature used in modern French), a form used specifically for Latin and for the Latinate spelling of the prefix pr√¶- in French, has been maintained.

### Normalized Transcription

The "normalized" transcription aims to provide an optimally readable
text, based on the principles commonly observed in modern critical
editions of middle-French texts for grammatical and lexical
disambiguation.

The following normalization protocols were applied:

  -  Capitalization and punctuation: the liberal use in Ms. Fr. 640 of capitals to mark the beginnings of both independent sentences and articulated clauses has been converted into modern punctuation, and capitals applied only to the initials of sentences and proper nouns.
  -  Word separation: blank spaces or apostrophes have been inserted, and no hyphens except to join two parts of a word that are separated in the original over a line break.
      - E.g. "laultre" normalized as "l‚Äôaultre"
  - Acute accents: **√©** marks stressed, i.e. non-mute, **e** in final syllables, but not in monosyllabic words except for disambiguation between homographs.
      - E.g. "apres" is normalized as "apr√©s" according to contemporary convention (rather than modern French "apr√®s"). This also disambiguates between "apr√©s" and "√¢pres" (although the latter does not occur in the manuscript).
  - A grave accent distinguishes **√†** (preposition) from **a** (verb), **l√†** (adverb) from **la** (article), and **o√π** (relative pronoun) from **ou** (conjunction).
  - Occasional diacritics: diereses and cedillas.
      - E.g. "No√´l" and "s√ßavoir"

### Deletions, Changes, and Marks

Both transcriptions document all deletions and changes in the
manuscript, even of minor slips of the pen, transcribed as far as
possible.

Ms. Fr. 640 contains conventional symbols for measurements, such as dram
and ounce, as well as for metals. These are rendered by unicode symbols,
as shown below.

The manuscript also contains many other marks that do not have unicode
equivalents, such as hash marks with three strokes rather than two.
These are rendered in the transcriptions and translation by thumbnail
figures excerpted from the
facsimile.

## Principles of Translation

The translation of Ms. Fr. 640 was carried out by graduate students and
Making and Knowing team members in Paleography and Text Workshops held
by the Making and Knowing Project from 2014 to 2018. It was then checked
and refined by the Paleography Lead Marc Smith and Senior Team
members, Cl√©ment Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Pamela Smith, Tillmann
Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.

There is no such thing as a perfect translation. It is always a
compromise, requiring interpretation and judgment, shaped by the
translator‚Äôs aims and priorities. Discerning the intended meaning of the
author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was particularly challenging because
it is a technical text containing many obscure and long-forgotten
materials and techniques, as well as because the author-practitioner
seems to have left the manuscript unfinished.

Any of the numerous moving parts of a sentence‚Äîobscure nouns, vague
adverbs, knotty subclauses, sequences of tenses and moods‚Äîmight hold
crucial clues to the success of a complex (and often unknown or lost)
process. Furthermore, the process of translation was carried out by
successive cohorts of students and team members in Paleography and Text
Workshops who generally had no special expertise in the obscure contents
of the manuscript. We translated collectively and in parallel with
laboratory reconstruction and textual research to interpret the text.
The translation underwent multiple campaigns of revision. Our
translation of Ms. Fr. 640 aims to avoid over-interpretation and
maintain ambiguity, providing as literal and consistent a rendering of
the original French as possible. This frequently meant foregoing a more
elegant solution in favor of a clunky and at times archaic rendering
which preserves the author-practitioner's rich, down-to-earth, and
occasionally rambling vernacular.

This "hands-off" approach applies first and foremost to technical terms.
Many sixteenth-century terms for processes and materials have been
obscured or subsumed into different categories in modern art historical
terminology. To keep the original meaning in view, we have refrained
from applying these modern categories wherever possible. For example,
the term *desmen√©e* in an entry on perspective (fol.
[62v](/folios/62v)
could easily be identified as the "vanishing point," but instead we
opted for the more neutral "intersection." Similarly, the entries on *or
mat* (fol. [66r](/folios/66r))
describe a process known as mordant gilding in modern English, but to
use that term would be tantamount to imposing a modern technical
definition on the author-practitioner‚Äôs understanding of the process.
Technical terms for pigments and other materials were a particular
challenge. The identity of *azur d‚Äôesmail* and a range of related blue
pigments in the manuscript has been an ongoing conundrum. Although we
are fairly confident, after extensive research and consultation with
experts over many years, that it refers to smalt, a blue glass
containing cobalt, we are reluctant to impose our conclusions on the
text. For this reason, *azur d‚Äôesmail*, *or mat*, and a range of other
terms have been left in the original French. Research essays or editorial notes
detail the state of our knowledge as to their identity.

For many French terms, we chose English translations from contemporary
dictionaries such as Cotgrave‚Äôs 1611 *Dictionarie of the French and
English Tongues*, even if they might seem obscure or archaic to modern
readers (see below the full list of dictionaries used). Even if a word
such as "mattrass," denoting a round-bottomed glass flask, is now rarely
used, it is by far the closest equivalent, both etymologically and in
terms of its technical meaning, to the French *mattelas*. There are
cases, however, where this strategy would have caused more confusion
that it is worth. The small paintbrush called *pinceau*, for example,
would have been known as a "pencil" in English from the sixteenth until
well into the nineteenth century. Being moreover etymologically related
to *pinceau*, "pencil" seems in many ways an ideal candidate. However,
while one might find a "camel hair pencil" in a catalogue of specialist
art equipment even today, the danger of confusing a brush with a
graphite pencil seemed too grave to be left to a disambiguating
editorial note on each instance of the word. Instead, on this occasion
we translated "paintbrush," prioritizing a clear reference to the
correct tool over the principle of avoiding modern categories.

While the language of Ms. Fr. 640 is overwhelmingly Middle French, some
small portion of the text (single words, phrases, or short passages) is in
languages other than French, including German, Italian, Greek, and Latin. Excerpts in these languages have been transcribed as they appear in the manuscript, marked up with the relevant language tag, and italicized in the Edition. An editorial note (marked by an asterisk) provides an English translation of this text. The author-practitioner also uses a
number of terms derived from Occitan. While Occitan was and is a language
in its own right, the author-practitioner does not appear to be an Occitan
speaker, but rather uses individual Occitan words, adapted to French
spelling to varying degrees, suggesting that these terms had currency in
the French spoken in the Toulouse area and the South more generally. For
this reason, we are not treating these individual terms as a separate
language like Latin or Italian, which the author-practitioner uses for
longer stretches of text. Instead, Occitan-derived terms are marked up
"silently" with the tag, i.e., they are not rendered as foreign words in
italics in the Edition, but can nonetheless be found in the [List of Entries](/entries) by selecting "Occitan" from the list of tags. The same goes for a number of terms in Poitevin, the dialect spoken in and around Poitou, which suggest that the author-practitioner may
hail from that region. These terms are silently marked up with the tag, which can also be selected from the tag set in the List of Entries.

Another important aim of our translation was to preserve the
peculiarities of the author-practitioner‚Äôs language. This includes the
odd not-quite-grammatical sentence, but, more importantly, the
author-practitioner‚Äôs language of things and processes, which is one of
the key elements that tell us something about his "material imaginary."
We paid particular attention to language describing materials as alive
and active, with a will of their own. *Azur d‚Äôesmail*, for example,
"hates more than any other to be ground, especially with water," and
with good reason, since this would mean that it "dies & loses all its
color" (fol. [58v](/folios/58v)).
While this literal translation may sound quaint to modern readers, for
early modern artists and artisans, there would have been nothing unusual
in supposing that matter was a live agent that had to be coaxed or
subdued into the service of human artifice. By preserving the
agency‚Äîgrammatical and semantic‚Äîof materials as well as humans and
animals, our translation aims to immerse the reader in the
author-practitioner‚Äôs words and world.

The entire translation was collaborative, and this was a challenge to
the consistency of translation. We therefore developed protocols to try
to limit the range of translations. This, too, can add to awkwardness in
phrasing, but we very much strove for a unified voice over the entire
manuscript‚Äîa goal, it must be said, that is somewhat at odds with the
nature of this compiled document. Consistency in translation of material
and process terms was also sought by compiling a glossary over the five
years of Text Workshops that specified to participants what word the
Project had settled on to translate certain oft-repeated words. This
formed the basis of the [Glossary](/folios/1r/f/1r/glossary) that is now available as one of the
pane views of the Edition. Editorial Team members then further enforced
this consistency by searching for commonly used terms or phrases in a
text editing program to make sure that they were translated with the
agreed-upon term. For example, we reviewed hundreds of variations of the
construction *il faut*, determining how to implement our self-imposed
consistency rules ("one needs (to do)," "one ought not," or "it is
necessary," depending on context) or depart from them in edge cases. The
exhilarating but alarming capacity that digital tools allow in enforcing
consistency in a document like this has resulted in a non-literary piece
of literature, as we consciously sacrificed elegance of prose in the
English for a literal rendering and an attempt not to over-interpret
passages whose meaning was unclear.

It must also be noted that the Making and Knowing Project created a
critical edition of a French manuscript with a research apparatus that
is mostly in English, which leads to a somewhat peculiar feature of
providing Editorial Comments across all three versions of the text, as
well as clarifications of meaning in Research Essays, almost entirely in
English. The advantage of the English translation, however, is that it
can serve as a form of index for the French versions of the text because
it contains single terms, whereas the French transcriptions contain many
variant spellings. Thus, if the reader wishes to search for a single
word, e.g., a type of material, the search can be undertaken in English,
and compared to the French variants.

All author additions and deletions, as well as Making and Knowing
editorial corrections to the text, were carried across and made visible
in all three versions of the text. We thought it useful to the reader to
see where the author-practitioner had rethought passages no matter which
version was being read. When it was possible to translate the deleted
words and phrases, we did so in the translation. Where a deleted word
was fragmentary and could not be translated, it was left in French,
indicated by italicized font, but this means there are sometimes
fragments of words interpolated into sentences and even other words.
They are, however, always visible as deletions by the struck-through red
font.

Finally, our translation was further constrained by the need to keep
encoding matched as much as possible across all three versions of the
text. This is desirable because it ensures matching data sets across all
versions of the text, allowing for digital analysis of the Project‚Äôs
data. While our translation is faithful to the original and, we hope,
useful for researchers from different disciplines, it can in some places
be challenging at first read. Our edition provides three different aids
to guide the reader across the rockier linguistic territory. Editorial
Comments, signalled by a red asterisk, contain information about the
historical context and translation decisions. The Glossary found on the
reading pane menus provides an alphabetical and searchable list of
distinctive terms used in Ms. Fr. 640 that the team identified as
needing individual definition, providing citations of source(s)
supporting our translation decisions. The Research Essays that accompany
*Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France* often explore linguistic particularities and the
interpretation of meaning.

## Principles of Encoding

The encoding of Ms. Fr. 640 was carried out by graduate students and
Making and Knowing team members in a series of Paleography and Text
Workshops held by the Making and Knowing Project from 2014 to 2018. It
was then checked and refined by the Digital Lead Terry Catapano and
Senior Team members, Clement Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz. The Project employed
XML markup based on the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI), but customized to accommodate project needs.

Each Text Workshop and encoding campaign necessitated a protocol in
order to train team members and make consistent the multiyear efforts.
These encoding protocols included an introduction to XML and TEI markup, and the principles of encoding for
Ms. Fr. 640 developed over the five years of the Project, as detailed
practical instructions. They made clear our recognition that encoding a text is an interpretive act, thus all tags
and encoding principles were discussed, reviewed, and revised multiple
times over the five years of creating *Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France*. They also set out
the Project‚Äôs underlying goal as the effort to "achieve accurate and
consistent markup of all three text versions of the manuscript. This is
a very detail-oriented endeavor, but will enable future users to analyze
the text in ways we have not conceived. We seek to make possible new
questions and new analyses of the text."

For more information on the process of encoding Ms. Fr. 640, see Celine
Camps and Margot Lyautey, [Ma\<r\>king and Knowing: Encoding BnF Ms. Fr.
640](/essays/ann_335_ie_19).

In 2017 the emerging tagset was formalized as a RelaxNG schema and
maintained in the [Project‚Äôs data repository in Github](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/schema/ms-transcription.md).

    thousands of museums, galleries and archives are digitizing their
    collections - creating virtual copies of their texts, imagery and
    objects that can be stored on local servers or in the cloud. Once
    these collections are made public online, we work hard to make
    sure other people can find and use them. For change. For ideas.

    History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590‚Äì1635: Documents from
    the Archivio di Stato di Roma* brings together a body of largely
    unpublished notarial records from the Trenta Notai Capitolini
    (TNC) found in the Archivio di Stato di Roma (ASR), many
    previously thought lost, concerning the institutional history of
    the Accademia. First mentioned in a brief from Pope Gregory XIII
    of 1577, a little over a decade after the conclusion of the last
    session of the Council of Trent, the Accademia di San Luca was
    intended to serve the educational, social, professional, and
    confraternal needs of the painters, sculptors, and architects of
    Rome.

    The TNA provides the following info, re: calculations and
    conversions: "The data used to provide the calculations for the
    currency converter has been collated from original documents and
    official statistics, and the survey of material used has been as
    comprehensive as possible. However, the results of the
    calculations are intended to be a general guide to historic
    values, rather than a categorical statement of fact.

      - The value of craft skills to facilitate innovation in science,
        technology and medicine is increasingly recognised. Parallel
        Practices a 2014 pilot led by Crafts Council in partnership
        with Cultural Institute at King‚Äôs College, London,
        demonstrated the positive healthcare impact of research and
        development collaborations between makers and medical
        professionals. The project stimulated learning and innovation
        through a focus on the body, materials and processes that
        inform clinical outcomes and artistic practice. Each residency
        involved a team of at least one maker and one medical and
        scientific academic.
