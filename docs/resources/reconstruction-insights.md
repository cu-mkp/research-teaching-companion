From 2014 through 2019, the Making and Knowing Project team along with students in the Craft and Science courses reconstructed a large number of the techniques and processes found in the ca. 930 entries of Ms. Fr. 640. This reconstruction involved conventional historical textual research, object-based study, and hands-on experiments in the Making and Knowing Lab. The students’ reconstructions provided the information and evidence for their essays, which form the critical commentary of this Edition. All student research also had the goal of building material and technical awareness.

The essays listed below showcase the research and insights gained from the reconstructions. Additional context for the Making and Knowing Project’s reconstructions can be found in Pamela H. Smith, [Making the Edition](/essays/ann_329_ie_19), and additional information about the Project’s reconstruction methods is provided by Joel A. Klein, [Methodologies for Making and Knowing: Reconstructions for Historical Research](/essays/ann_322_ie_19).

## Materials
Students explored early modern materials, such as alabaster sand, and other sands (or, powders) for molding, imitation coral, lute varnish, sand for hourglasses, a blue pigment called *azur d’esmail*, dragon’s blood, black sulfured wax, wax for seals, and fish glue, among many others:

## Culinary and Medical Recipes
There are only a handful of culinary recipes in the manuscript, but students reconstructed some of them, for example, "Excellent mustard" and the Toulouse specialty of millet bread, *Millas*. Students explored the medical cures and remedies in the manuscript, considering the place of medical recipes in this mostly art and technical manuscript, attempting to determine the likely meaning of the abbreviation "G.," seeking to understand the use of rosemary in pipe smoking, deciphering the use of a medicinal plaster "for preventing teats from swelling," and recreating the impressive inspiriting of a salve for burns by means of holy water and intensive repetitions of the Pater Noster prayer.

## Deciphering the Text
The research of many students aimed to decipher the text, such as the puzzling marginal note "try burnt oysters," or investigating the significant contrast between the terms *imiter* (to imitate) and *contrefaire* (to counterfeit), the meaning of "invention" and "curious" in this period, the meaning of "aquafortis" (usually taken to mean nitric acid, but clearly more complicated in Ms. Fr. 640), and the process of pinking satin.

## Reconstructing Historical Techniques
Reconstruction has been especially useful for comprehending long lost or obscure techniques, for which Ms. Fr. 640 often has remarkably detailed descriptions. These include "incuse reverse casting," or, as Ms. Fr. 640 has it, "Molding a hollow on one side and in relief on the other" (*Mouler cave d’un coste et de relief de laultre*), casting from life, casting in cuttlefish bone, making pilgrim badges, casting paper with raised text, casting sugar sculptures, techniques for painting on taffeta (probably for processional banners or clothing), a surprising black dye, making and applying black varnish for armor, making "gold without gold on silver"—a yellow turmeric varnish probably for furniture, paint for metal objects, entitled "Colors for Green," *or mat* (mordant gilding), applying sulfuric acid on paper, reverse painting on glass, gilding on paper,  creating varnishes to withstand the rain, preserving flowers in sand, and animals preserved by drying in an oven then decorated with wings.

Some techniques are known from other technical texts, but the accounts of these techniques in Ms. Fr. 640 often contain puzzling components or interesting technical details, such as those for making paint brushes, counterproofing, building up flesh tones, polishing and engraving stones, distilling turpentine, the construction of a fuse for a siege weapon known as a petard, and lampworking. Other recipes needed reconstructing in order to begin to understand their implausible instructions, such as bread molding, and an alchemical process of producing a powder for gold by enclosing silkworms in a vessel.

All these essays not only provide accounts of the students’ reconstructions of techniques in the manuscript, but also contain examinations of the historical significance and contexts of the materials and techniques

## Historical Investigation
Some essays provide wide ranging historical investigation of the object that is the aim of a recipe, for example, the significance of roses in sixteenth-century Toulouse, bread in sixteenth-century France, the landscape of cures in sixteenth-century Europe, writing tablets, a musical automaton—a "spinet playing by itself," the construction of decorative grottos, learning to draw, and sleight of hand tricks. Other essays compare Ms. Fr. 640 to contemporary texts, such as Hugh Plat’s *Jewell House of Art and Nature* and Charles Estienne’s *La Maison Rustique*.

## Workshop Practice and Daily Life
Through research and reconstruction, we also learned more about workshop practice and the nature of experiential or practical knowledge, as revealed, for example, in the author-practitioner’s use of particular terminology, such as "impalpable," and his use of artisanal tricks of the trade such as the squeeze test for ascertaining the consistency of molding sand, and the paper test to measure heat. The research also yielded clues about the author-practitioner’s identity, as well as his level of education, knowledge and practice, and his familiarity with techniques outside of his French-speaking domain. Student research also provided insight into daily life, such as recipes for mustard, the use of noisy mortars by apothecaries to attract business, a method to train a dog (involving cheese held in the armpit, fol. 131r), millet consumption, woad cultivation in Languedoc, the regular use of stale urine, and the unexpected domestic production of sand for hourglasses.

## Failures
Students also found evidence that the author-practitioner experienced failures in his practice, for example in making imitation rubies, or in making sand molds for casting metal. In some of the manuscript’s entries, the author-practitioner appears to have recorded his experiences, perhaps as he was learning, while others seem to be hearsay or observations from other workshops. When students made mistakes and went back to the manuscript to try to understand where they had gone wrong, they sometimes found that the author-practitioner had included a warning about just their problem, as if he too had experienced it. For example, while making molds for lifecasting, we made the clay walls of the mold too thin, and they collapsed under the outward pressure of the plaster "sand" as we poured it into the mold. When we went back to the manuscript, we found that the author-practitioner had warned us about just this problem, saying, "take heed to make [the clay circle] strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would burst, the sand being inside" (fol. 145v).

## Material Imaginary
Especially interesting has been the insight provided by reconstruction into the author-practitioner’s system of knowledge about nature and the behavior of natural materials—his "material imaginary"—including qualitative material categories, such as hot, cold, wet, dry, fat, lean, sweet, and sour; material metaphors based on, for example, the materials of vermilion and of sulfur, which provided a means, not so much to signify material meaning (although they also enabled that), but, rather, to enact principles of material process. The author-practitioner’s vocabulary of moldmaking and casting conveys a conception of the material world as animate, such as veins of wax (*filons de cire*) and breathing holes (*souspirails*) to vent the mold (fol. 155r). The interactions between materials often demonstrate a view of materials being friendly or hostile. For example, "Latten is the enemy of gold & the friend of silver" (*Le letton est ennemy de lor & amy de largent*, fol. 121v). His material imaginary also included various areas or activities of emphasis, such as experimenting with the states and phases of materials, or trying to arrest ephemerality in living things through lifecasting, preserving plants and fruits, and taxidermy. In most of the recipes, we see that human utility is the overarching organizing principle in creating (mostly implicit) taxonomies of natural materials.

## Artifice
The central preoccupation of the author-practitioner that emerged from the Project’s research was that of creating artificial materials. This overarching concern with artifice reveals the imitation of nature by the human hand as an essential mode of investigating nature and natural materials through the crafting of objects. In the years that the Project focused on techniques for coloring diverse materials and on "ephemeral art" (temporary art for civic and court festivals), students reconstructed many artificial materials, such as emeralds and other precious stones, imitation jasper, marbled wood, imitation rouge clair, imitation damask cloth, and "color of gold without gold."

## Reading and Doing
The Project has taught all its many participants how much information the reconstruction of technical recipes can yield. One of the most important results of reconstruction was gaining a new level of understanding of the recipes. By the constant moving between manuscript and hands-on experimentation, we gained an understanding of the manuscript that would not have been possible by simply reading through it in a linear way (which, given the extreme non-linearity of the text and its contents, would have been near impossible in any case). We have also learned from our hands-on historical research that reconstruction-based investigations can provide another window into artisanal workshop practices, but it can also make us aware of our inevitable "modern framings" or "lenses" through which we tend to look at the material world of the early modern period. Our research in materials suggests the inadequacy of some modern classifications to convey, not only the variety of that early modern material world, but also the ways in which practitioners thought with and through their materials and experiences to form hypotheses, taxonomies, and knowledge systems.
