Sometime after 1579, an anonymous individual began recording many different processes and techniques we would now classify as belonging to the fine arts, crafts, and various technologies.

Over the course of an unknown span of time (probably until 1588), this person filled 170 folios (or 340 single pages) with closely-written text and some hand-drawn figures containing recipes, instructions, fragmentary notes, firsthand accounts of trials with many materials and techniques, and observations on myriad subjects, including drawing instruction, pigment application, dyeing, coloring of metal, wax, and wood, imitation gem production, making molds and metal casts, arms and armor, plant and tree cultivation, preservation of animals, plants, and foodstuffs, distillation of turpentine, and much else.

The resulting manuscript, now housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) as Ms. Fr. 640, has been preserved since the early seventeenth century in the binding of Philippe de Béthune, count of Selles and Charost, apparently the manuscript’s first owner. Entitled *Choses diverses* (diverse things) on its spine, it entered the King’s Library (the core of the later BnF) as part of the donation of the Béthune family’s library in 1662 by Philippe’s son, Hippolyte de Béthune.
Ms. Fr. 640 is a unique record giving insight into many subjects, but is focused especially on processes and practices of making things from natural materials. Thus, it is an especially valuable source for the history of craft and material culture, and for the history of art and science in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Many things about this manuscript are, however, extraordinarily intriguing and puzzling.

<!-- =========== THE EDITION =========== -->
## The Edition

### What is the Digital Critical Edition?

This digital critical edition and English translation of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640, held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text in French transcription and English translation for the first time, and situates its contents in their material and historical context.

The manuscript provides insights into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century, and brings a better understanding of how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected and appreciated in early modern Europe.

The Making and Knowing Project has created this Edition through a series of collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that involved students, craft practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and social sciences, natural and computer scientists, and scholar-practitioners from the emerging field of the digital humanities.

### Creation of the Edition
The creation of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been the primary goal of the Making and Knowing Project since it was founded in 2014. It presents the culmination of over five years of iterative, collaborative, and interdisciplinary work.

The Edition was developed through a series of  workshops, courses, and conferences:

#### Text Workshops
The first stage of transcription, translation, and encoding of the manuscript was carried out in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014–2018) that brought together graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to learn to read middle French script through transcription exercises and then through intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640.

The manuscript’s encoding explores fourteen semantic categories that the Project deemed meaningful in providing insight into the manuscript: animal, body part, currency, environment, material, measurement, medical, music, personal name, place, plant, profession, sensory, and tool.

For more information, see [Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding](/content/resources/principles).

#### Laboratory Seminars and Research Essays
Students in the Making and Knowing Project’s laboratory seminars from 2014 to 2018 used the transcriptions and translations to investigate the materials and techniques contained in the manuscript.

<iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/384070452" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

These students produced essays that featured their research on texts and objects, as well as their experiments in reconstructing the technical processes and recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. The essays gloss entries in Ms. Fr. 640 and provide contextual information for the manuscript more generally.

The student essays were edited extensively by members of the Making and Knowing Project team, after which scholars participating in annual Working Group Meetings commented upon them. They were edited again in 2019 by the Making and Knowing Senior Project team.

The research apparatus of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ also includes a collection of research essays authored by Working Group members and invited collaborators that discuss different aspects of the context of Ms. Fr. 640. For more, see [Research Essays](/essays).



<!-- =========== THE MAKING AND KNOWING PROJECT =========== -->
## About the Making and Knowing Project

The [Making and Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org/), founded in 2014 by Pamela H. Smith, and involving hundreds of collaborators, is a research and pedagogical initiative in the [Center for Science and Society](https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. See [Credits](/content/about/credits) and, on the Project's website, [Collaborations](https://www.makingandknowing.org/collaborators/).

The Project explores the intersections between historical craft making and scientific knowing. Drawing on techniques from both laboratory and archival research as well as studio practice and the digital humanities, the Making and Knowing Project aims to cross the science/humanities divide.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/384070384" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The creation of _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been the Project’s primary endeavor since 2014. This goal has shaped the Project’s methodology of fusing pedagogy with research, using a focused research object (Ms. Fr. 640) to teach historical, hands-on, and digital research methods while generating research outputs.

![about-mk-collab-lab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/about-mk-collab-lab.png)

_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ sheds light not only on what kind of knowledge the manuscript’s anonymous author-practitioner possessed about techniques and materials, but also, more broadly, how his work of making was related to knowing.

Indeed, the overarching theme of the Project and its work on _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France_ has been to show the ways in which making is an epistemic activity. In other words, making is itself a form of knowledge and not just an application of knowledge.

<!-- =========== DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT =========== -->
## Digital Development

_Secrets of Craft and Nature_ first publicly launched in February 2020 after the culmination of more than six years of research, teaching, and collaboration. The digital development of the Edition has taken place in tandem with content development, creating an iterative workflow between technical and editorial activities. This brought together members of the Making and Knowing Project, [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), and the Columbia University Libraries, as well as numerous students and collaborators as detailed further in the Edition's [Credits](/content/about/credits). Under the technical direction of Digital Lead Terry Catapano, Nick Laiacona of Performant Software developed the critical edition website as well as the data workflow for publishing the editorial team's content.

### Introduction and Sustainability
As a digital scholarly publication, _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_ aims to make all online content openly and sustainably available. The creation of the Edition by the Making and Knowing Project employed evolving approaches and methodologies to facilitate the multifaceted collaborative research process. At the same time, the digital development of the Edition has prioritized the generation and preservation of all Project data in sustainable, open formats to ensure adherence to open-access and open-source standards wherever possible. This commitment is founded on the conviction that the Edition should serve as a resource to a wide and diverse audience, enabling knowledge exchange now and into the future.

The focus on sustainability is guided by the principles of [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/) which the Project applies through an emphasis on durability and the use of basic technologies and workflows that have a greater likelihood of persisting. The Edition relies upon a common and well-established technology stack: HTML/HTML5 with CSS and JavaScript served statically from a webserver. Until the Edition is archived for long-term preservation, infrastructure and content assets are developed and maintained using Apache HTTP Server, React JavaScript Library, Github, AWS CloudFront and S3, and DigitalOcean virtual servers. Data format and storage decisions are chosen for their ability to be readily transformed to multiple target formats, and content is routinely exported and converted to open standard formats.

The component parts of the Edition are detailed further below. For more information, please also see [About the Edition](#creation-of-the-edition) and the essays by Terry Catapano and Naomi Rosenkranz, [BnF Ms. Fr. 640 as a Digital Text](/essays/ann_310_ie_19) and Pamela H. Smith, [Making the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640](/essays/ann_329_ie_19).

### Facsimile Images of BnF Ms. Fr. 640
The digital facsimile images of Ms. Fr. 640 are provided by the BnF’s digital library, [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g). They are integrated into the Edition through its IIIF Manifest, which relates the Project's transcription and translation of the manuscript to the corresponding Gallica folio images via the IIIF Presentation API.

### Markup and Encoding of the Text of Ms. Fr. 640
The [texts of Ms. Fr. 640](/folios) are encoded in XML format and available in the [Project's Github repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data). Each folio of the manuscript is represented as individual XML files in three versions:
1. Diplomatic: diplomatic (verbatim) transcription of the original French text
2. Normalized: lightly normalized French transcription (with punctuation and diacritical marks added)
3. Translation: English translation

The transcription, translation, and encoding of the manuscript were primarily carried out in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014–2018) that brought together graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to learn to read middle French script and gain experience in textual encoding. For more detail and a discussion of this process, see Celine Camps and Margot Lyautey, [Ma&#60;r&#62;king and Knowing: Encoding BnF Ms. Fr. 640](/essays/ann_335_ie_19). The XML files were then revised and finalized by Senior Project team members and the Digital Lead. See also Terry Catapano and Naomi Rosenkranz, [BnF Ms. Fr. 640 as a Digital Text](/essays/ann_310_ie_19) and Pamela H. Smith, [Making the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640](/essays/ann_329_ie_19).

The texts conform to a schema developed iteratively by the Project as the transcriptions and translation were revised and completed. While intended to meet the specific needs of the Project, the custom schema is influenced by and derives much of its tagset from the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/P5/). The [schema](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/schema/ms-transcription.rng) is maintained in the Project repository. The [Principles of Encoding](/content/resources/principles#principles-of-encoding) provide a full description of the Project's tagset.

### Use of the XML in the Edition
The XML files encoded during the paleography and text workshops and painstakingly revised by the editorial team over the course of the project are stored in the [ms-xml/ directory](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/ms-xml) of the Project's Github repository. The XML markup drives a number of important functions of the Edition:

* It organizes the manuscript text into the component entries with Project-assigned unique identifiers and thematic categories
* It specifies the relative positions of the textual blocks on each page to approximate the layout of the original manuscript
* It designates the occurrence of figures, illustration, marks, and other non-textual elements of the manuscript
* It indicates textual features such as authorial deletions, additions, insertions, and gaps in the text
* It labels segments of text related to concepts of interests to the Project, such as materials, tools, plants, and animals mentioned in an entry
* It encodes editorial notes that provide additional information, such as historical context, technical and material explanations, and transcription and translation decisions

All this information is converted into HTML and JSON as well as compiled into a search index by "Lizard," a command line tool that performs these functions to generate the static content of the site. Lizard is named after one of the manuscript's sketches on fol. [124v](/folios/124v), which also serves as the Project's logo. Some of Lizard's functions include:

```
$ scripts/lizard.js help
Usage: lizard.js <command> <target>
A helpful lizard that responds to the following <command>s:
        download-thumbs: Download essay thumbnails from Google Drive via rclone.
        download: Download only essays marked with 'refresh'.
        process: Process the downloaded files and place them on the asset server.
        manifest: Create the IIIF Manifest and associated files.
        assets: Process the manuscript data and edition webpages and index them.
        figures: Copy the manuscript figures into the target directory.
        env: Create the environment files for development and production.
        index: Create a search index of the essays.
        run: Download, process, manifest, assets, figures, env, and index.
        init: Download all, download thumbs, and run.
        help: Displays this help.
<target> is the target key from the edition_data/config.json file. Defaults to 'local'.
```

Once Lizard has done its job, the generated site is then packaged up and sent to a web server, currently hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The files are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for display on the web. Each build has a unique ID, so it easy to roll back to a previous version.

For a more technical review of these functions, please see the README in the [Github repository of the Edition's software](https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition).

### Layout of the Texts of Ms. Fr. 640

The Making and Knowing Grid Layout is a rendering scheme designed to faithfully render the layout of a single column of text, consisting of multiple entries, surrounded by marginalia. Each entry is given a unique id and may contain zero or more marginal notes. The marginal notes are wrapped in `<ab>` tags. The editor may specify the arrangement of these notes relative to the entry using the `<margin>` tag. Valid values for the margin tag are:

* top note is above the entry and in the same column as the entry
* left-top note is above and to the left of the entry
* left-middle note is beside the entry to the left
* left-bottom note is below and to the left of the entry
* right-top note is above and to the right of the entry
* right-middle note is beside the entry to the right
* right-bottom note is below and to the right of the entry
* bottom note is below the entry and in the same column as the entry

These grid locations are relative to the entry. For example, in folio 4r, there are two entries. Both entries have notes in the left margin beside them. Each margin note is marked as "left-middle".

Additional Notes:

* If there are multiple notes with the same grid location, such as in folio 4v, they are rendered in the same grid location in the order they appear in the transcription.
* Content in the main entry div will take up both the middle and the right columns unless there are notes in the right column.
* Figures inherit the positioning of the `<ab>` block they are contained in.

### Other Resources and Derivative Versions

A number of supplementary resources are maintained in the Project's Github repository:
- The content of the Editorial Comments are edited in a spreadsheet table by the Editorial Team and exported in CSV format for integration into the static-site-generated Edition. Each comment is anchored at the appropriate location in the XML folio files by use of an XML element which contains the ID for the corresponding record in the comment table.
- The [Glossary](/folios/1r/f/1r/glossary) is similarly edited in a spreadsheet table by the Editorial Team and exported in CSV format for integration into the Edition.
- The source bibliographic metadata for the [Bibliography](/content/resources/bibliography) is maintained in BibTeX and HTML formats in the Project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/bibliographies).

To facilitate reuse and analysis of the Project's edited and encoded text of Ms. Fr. 640, files are provided in alternative formats including:
- [allFolios](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/allFolios): for each version of the manuscript (diplomatic transcription, normalized transcription, and English translation), a single XML file containing each folio concatenated together
- [entries](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/entries): for each version, every entry as a single file in both XML and TXT formats
- [ms-txt](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/ms-txt): for each version, every folio as a single file in TXT format.

### Research and Scholarly Essays

All [essays](/essays) are edited and maintained in the Project's Google Drive in order to best facilitate the collaborative process. Each essay in the Drive has uniform organization and style to ensure consistency and allow for conversion to HTML and integration into the Edition. The Research and Scholarly Essays are supplemented with additional information (including Project-assigned themes, associated entries, and citation information) in a spreadsheet table and exported in CSV format for integration into the Edition.

For persistent access, each essay has been assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and will also be archived in Columbia University [Academic Commons](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/) and downloadable as standalone publications.

### Static Site Generation

Most websites are typically created using a content management system (CMS) in which the site's content is kept in a database and rendered into HTML when requested. This approach often requires the employment of proprietary software as well as a large number of resources, institutional support, or constant maintenance. Static site generation, unlike CMS or database-driven projects, allows websites to be created with significantly fewer dependencies, and reduces maintenance overhead, as well as minimizes the risk of technological obsolescence. Content is already in its final form (as static pages are created beforehand) and can be sent as-is to the user.

Static site generation thus offers a number of advantages. It allows individualized software decisions and better control and maintenance of the site. Furthermore, open-source web servers like Apache and Nginx can very efficiently serve large amounts of static data and respond to increased user traffic, leading to lower server costs. Because this is a well-established, fundamental web technology, techniques for serving static sites are likely to persist into the future as well as be universally understood by IT professionals tasked with keeping the assets online.

The biggest challenge in developing a website using this approach is that one needs to adopt or build an appropriate static site generator for the project. There are a number of existing static site generators including the most well known, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll powers [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which allows a user to easily turn a Github repository into a static website. While Jekyll was initially considered, the specific requirements and desired features of the Edition led to the decision to build our own system using the Ruby programming language.

The content for _Secrets of Craft and Nature_ involved the scholarly work of a number of different editors, teams, and collaborators working over several years to explore the intricacies of a complex historical text, Ms. Fr. 640. To facilitate the collaborative methods, most of this data was worked on in the Project's Google Drive. As the Project evolved and came closer to digital publication, more and more data was moved to Github repositories. At the same time, content was still under development, and there was a need to draw from both Github and Google Drive at build time.

Digital development of the Project has taken place in tandem with content development leading to an important feature of the Project's workflow: the ability to see real-time changes of the content in place. In order to approximate the rendering of the text's transcription and translation as closely as possible to the original manuscript, it was necessary to see how the transcribed XML looked in the diplomatic rendering on the website. A staging server was thus set up to automatically regenerate the folio views every few minutes.

Although very simple server technology is utilized, this did not preclude us from using the latest client technology to render the site in the user's web browser, including [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to develop the user interface. The static data was a mix of pre-rendered HTML pages and pre-rendered JSON data structures which were then processed by React to produce the final site.

<!-- =========== PEER REVIEW =========== -->
## Peer Review
This Edition and its research apparatus have been created collectively
and have been the objects of intense collective review, discussion, and
iterated examination and revision. Because of its format and extensive
scope—three versions of the manuscript and more than 100 research
essays—it was not sent out for peer review.

Instead, a form of "open review" was instituted: each of the student
essays was edited at least three times by different members of the
Making and Knowing Team and then read and commented upon by a scholar
within whose expertise the subject of the essay fell.

After this, students had an opportunity to revise the essay, and,
finally, the essay was edited in a final editorial campaign by the
Making and Knowing Team (Clément Godbarge, Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape,
Tianna Uchacz). The essays authored by invited scholars were workshopped
among all authors at a collective co-writing workshop in 2019, and also
underwent editorial review by Making and Knowing team members.

For more information on open review see the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation White Paper [Open Review: A Study of Contexts and Practices](http://mcpress.media-commons.org/open-review/files/2012/06/MediaCommons_Open_Review_White_Paper_final.pdf).




The extremely diverse and often obscure materials and techniques treated
in the essays would have presented a problem for conventional peer
review because a large number of reviewers with diverse areas of
expertise would have been needed. Instead, critical oversight was built
into the annual Working Group Meeting, when scholars were selected for
their expertise on the subjects of the essays produced in a given year,
were assigned a number of essays, and commented formally on the essays
in the three-day meeting.

![peerreview-group-table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/peerreview-group-table.png)

The Project also wished to build into the collaborative structure the
opportunity presented by this intriguing primary source for students to
interact around substantive questions with accomplished scholars. This
was achieved in the process of review and critique at the annual Working
Group Meetings.

The Project believes this solution not only succeeded in integrating
phases of pedagogy and research and provided valuable opportunities for
graduate students to be mentored by emerging and established scholars,
but also resulted in a more thorough (and pedagogically useful) review
of the diverse contents of the essays than might have been provided by
conventional methods of peer review.

While no method of peer review is foolproof, the Project believes that
its process of review and revision maintained quality and consistency in
its expansive research apparatus. As the practice of historical
scholarship changes, whether through collective research and authorship
or through new approaches such as digital methods and laboratory
research on historical questions, it seems necessary for the practices
and parameters for scholarly peer review to adapt to these emergent
modes of scholarship.
