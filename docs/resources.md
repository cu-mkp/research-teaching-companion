<!-- =========== LIST OF ENTRIES =========== -->
## List of Entries

The manuscript consists almost entirely of units of text under titles, which the Project has called "entries." The List of Entries forms an index to navigate the over 900 entries.

Entries can be filtered by selecting semantic tags that have been used to encode relevant terms in each entry. For further information on these tags, see [Principles of
Encoding](/content/resources/principles#principles-of-encoding).

<!-- =========== ENTRY CATEGORIES =========== -->
## Entry Categories

Entries can be faceted through 26 broad categories, which are intended to provide a quick overview of processes and materials and to help navigate
the manuscript.

For more information about the manuscript’s contents, see
Pamela H. Smith, [An Introduction to Ms. Fr. 640 and its
Author-Practitioner](/essays/ann_300_ie_19).

The manuscript BnF Ms. Fr. 640 mostly consists of units of text under titles, which the Project has called "entries."

The over 900 entries have been grouped by the Making and Knowing Project into 26 broad categories, loosely corresponding to topics that the Project felt represented core preoccupations of the author-practitioner.

Each entry was assigned up to three of the 26 categories. For example, *Tablettes* (Tablets) on fol. [15v](/folios/15v) is categorized under "wood and its coloring," "decorative," and "tool."

These categories form an index created by the Project to ease navigation of the manuscript.

<!-- =========== BIBLIOGRAPHY =========== -->
## Bibliography

The Bibliography compiles references, texts, and authors cited in Ms. Fr. 640, in the Edition's editorial comments, and in the Glossary.

This Bibliography includes detailed references for primary sources cited in the manuscript, including—whenever possible—permanent links to electronic facsimiles. Because Ms. Fr. 640 rarely specifies a particular printed edition, the references provided here are those that are more widely available and/or were produced by prominent sixteenth-century publishers (Robert and Henri Estienne, the Aldine press, Christophe Plantin, Hieronymus Froben, Johannes Herwagen, etc.). Other possible editions can be found in the [Universal Short Title Catalogue](https://www.ustc.ac.uk) and similar resources.

The bibliographic databases are available as [BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) and HTML, downloadable from the Project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/bibliographies).

<!-- =========== PRINCIPLES =========== -->
## Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding

To transform the handwritten pages of Ms. Fr. 640 into digital text, the Making and Knowing Project transcribed, translated, and encoded Ms. Fr. 640 in a series of collaborative workshops for graduate students since 2014. The protocols guiding this process evolved into these Principles.

[View the Principles >>](/content/resources/principles)

A list of dictionaries and technical encyclopedias was also developed during the
transcription and translation effort.

<!-- =========== RECONSTRUCTION INSIGHTS =========== -->
## Reconstruction Insights

One of the key methods for studying the processes and materials described in Ms. Fr. 640 was the historical reconstruction of its entries. This resource provides a guide to research essays that discuss insights gained through laboratory reconstructions by the Project.

<!-- =========== FIELD NOTES =========== -->
## Field Notes (coming soon)

Field notes document students' skill-building exercises and reconstruction work for their Research Essays.

While the Project required students to record every stage of their research, field notes differ in detail and completeness.

Additional photographs taken by the students as they carried out their
research are available in the [Project’s repository on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/albums).
